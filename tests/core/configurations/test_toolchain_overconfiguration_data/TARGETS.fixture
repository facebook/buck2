# This target is built in the `cat` platform. It gets a dependency chain like
#
#  top (cat)
#  toolchain (cat) (dog)
#  base (dog)
#
# In the past, a limitation of the toolchain deps implementation would configure the toolchain deps
# of `:top` in all exec platforms, even if the first one (`:dog` in this case) suffices. This
# resulted in an incorrectly reported cycle like this:
#
#  top (cat)
#  toolchain (cat) (cat)
#  base (cat)
#  top (cat)
