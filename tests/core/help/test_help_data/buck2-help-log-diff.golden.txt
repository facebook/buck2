Subcommands for diff'ing two buck2 commands

Usage: buck2 log diff [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  action-divergence  Identifies the first divergent action between two builds. Divergence is
                     identified by the same action having differing outputs. Useful for identifying
                     non-determinism
  external-configs   Identifies the diff between external buckconfigs between two commands
  help               Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
