//! Explicit access to fields that can be materialized on demand.
//!
//! [`Deferred::new`] stores an already available value. [`Deferred::read`]
//! returns the value, materializing it if necessary; [`Deferred::peek`] only
//! inspects whether it is available. Cloning materializes the value, but
//! formatting with `Debug` and memory accounting do not. A deferred slice's
//! length is known without materializing its elements, although reading that
//! metadata can wait for another thread.
//!
//! Constructors store resident values. Deserialization can defer heap-backed
//! fields when enabled for the storage; it is eager by default. Unread fields
//! require that storage to remain open, and report a read failure if it closes.
