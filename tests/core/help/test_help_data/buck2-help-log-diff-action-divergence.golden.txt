# This file is @generated, regenerate by re-running test with `-- --env BUCK2_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` appended to the test command

Identifies the first divergent action between two builds. Divergence is identified by the same
action having differing outputs. Useful for identifying non-determinism

Usage: buck2 log diff action-divergence [OPTIONS] <--path1 <PATH1>|--trace-id1 <TRACE_ID1>|--recent1 <NUMBER>> <--path2 <PATH2>|--trace-id2 <TRACE_ID2>|--recent2 <NUMBER>>

Options:
      --path1 <PATH1>
          A path to an event-log file of the first command

      --trace-id1 <TRACE_ID1>
          Trace id of the first command

      --recent1 <NUMBER>
          Open the event-log file from a recent command for the first command

      --path2 <PATH2>
          A path to an event-log file of the second command

      --trace-id2 <TRACE_ID2>
          Trace id of the second command

      --recent2 <NUMBER>
          Open the event-log file from a recent command for the second command

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [env: BUCK_VERBOSE=]
          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
