# This file is @generated, regenerate by re-running test with `-- --env BUCK2_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` appended to the test command

Generates web browser view that shows actions that ran in the last build mapped to the target graph

Usage: buck2 explain [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          Output file path for profile data.

          File will be created if it does not exist, and overwritten if it does.

      --upload
          Whether to upload the output to Manifold Deprecated: now we always upload to Manifold,
          this flag is a no-op

      --stack
          Add target code pointer. This invalidates cache, slowing things down

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
