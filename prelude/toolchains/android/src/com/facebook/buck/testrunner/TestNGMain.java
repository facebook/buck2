 * Launcher for TestNG.

 * <p>Expected arguments are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>(string) output directory
 *   <li>(long) default timeout in milliseconds (0 for no timeout)
 *   <li>(string) newline separated list of test selectors
 *   <li>(string...) fully-qualified names of test classes
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>IMPORTANT! This class limits itself to types that are available in both the JDK and Android
 * Java API. The objective is to limit the set of files added to the ClassLoader that runs the test,
 * as not to interfere with the results of the test.
