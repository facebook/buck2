/// The two heaps of a [`Module`](crate::environment::Module): the value heap and the frozen heap
/// it is building, owned together.
///
/// Values allocated on the frozen heap are handed out at the value heap's brand, through the
/// [`HeapEdge`] that [`frozen_heap`](ModuleHeaps::frozen_heap) provides. That is sound because the
/// builder never leaves this type unsealed: [`seal_with`](ModuleHeaps::seal_with) and [`Drop`] are its
/// only exits, and both seal it into the value heap's references. `seal_with` does so whether its
/// closure returns `Ok` or `Err`, and `Drop` covers a module that is never frozen as well as a
/// closure that unwinds (skipping a builder nothing was allocated on, which has nothing at `'fm`
/// to keep alive). The edge therefore exists from the moment the two heaps do, with nothing to
/// remember at the end.
///
/// The other direction is covered too: the two heaps hold one set of references between them. A
/// heap that either of them comes to depend on (the value heap through a `load` or an
/// `add_to_heap`, the builder through the globals' edge) is a dependency of both from that moment
/// on, so the builder, and the sealed heap it becomes, keeps alive every heap that a frozen value
/// at `'v` can have been copied out of, and does so from the moment the value heap references
/// it rather than from sealing.

        //      rebrand (`add_to_heap`, `OwnedFrozenReconstructor::edge`), which puts the value's

        //      into heaps its heap references (the contract on `Value<'v>` that the `branding`
        //      module opens with, which every allocator enforces through its brand).
