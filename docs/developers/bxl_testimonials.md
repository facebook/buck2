## C++ LSP

> *"On top of the 2x performance improvement we already have with buck1 -> buck2, BXL brought another 3x ~ 4x improvement. With those added together, generating compilation database in Buck2 will be 6x ~ 8x faster than Buck1."*

## XCode project generation

> *"It’s faster and much easier to work with than the equivalent stack in Python. In Python, we’d have to issue a query, parse the output into BuildTarget objects, process them, perform additional queries or build targets/subtargets, etc. Doing the equivalent in BXL removed a lot of inefficiencies and made working with configured targets much easier."*

For Rust Analyzer:

> *"It was my first time using BXL, and it allowed me to get rid of about 800 lines of Rust code and replace it with about 60 lines of BXL. It's really handy."*

## Pyre

> *"We found that our new BXL-based Buck-invoking logic outperformed its predecessor significantly, especially on incremental checks. P95 of Buck build time during Pyre incremental check is reduced by 95.7% for FBCode overall, after the release of the new logic, going from 332 seconds down to 14.3 seconds. That is a ~23x speed improvement! As a result, P95 of the overall time it takes for Pyre to respond after each incremental file save in FBCode has dropped from 193ms to 28ms."*
