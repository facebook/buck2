//! Project-agnostic filesystem utilities for Buck2.
//!
//! This crate contains filesystem types and utilities that have no knowledge
//! of Buck2 projects, cells, or build artifacts. It provides:
//! - Path types (ForwardRelativePath, AbsPath, AbsNormPath, FileName)
//! - Filesystem utilities (fs_util, async_fs_util)
//! - Working directory management (cwd, working_dir)
//!
//! For project-aware filesystem functionality, see the `buck2_core::fs` module.
