//! Vocabulary types for persisting the local dep-file (local action) cache to disk.
//!
//! The in-memory cache (`DEP_FILES`) lives in `buck2_action_impl`; the SQLite database lives in
//! `buck2_execute_impl`; and the daemon assembles them in `buck2_server`. None of those three
//! crates depend on each other, so the shared types and the late-bound handles that bridge them
//! live here in `buck2_execute`, which they all depend on.
