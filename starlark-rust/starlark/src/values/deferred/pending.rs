//! Resolution of an unread [`Deferred`] field.
//!
//! Three structures coordinate the readers of one field:
//! - The process-wide registry behind [`active_reads`], keyed by field
//!   address. A field under resolution holds only `RESOLVING`, so the registry
//!   is what keeps its [`Pending`] record reachable for metadata readers and
//!   what hands the record to exactly one resolver. It is global because the
//!   field is a single word with no room for a ticket.
//! - The storage's `StarlarkDeserWaitGraph`, in which the resolver claims
//!   `DeserWaitKey::Field(address)` and a blocked reader records its wait, so
//!   a read that would wait on a value under construction on the same thread,
//!   or the reverse, is reported as a cycle rather than deadlocking.
//! - A per-read [`ActiveRead`] condvar that later readers of the same field
//!   block on until the resolver publishes.
//!
//! Lock order: the registry, then a ticket's `done` mutex, then the wait
//! graph's locks. The registry is never held across a wait or a load.
