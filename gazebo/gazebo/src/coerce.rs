/// A marker trait such that the existence of `From: Coerce<To>` implies
/// that `From` can be treat as `To` without any data manipulation.
/// Particularly useful for containers, e.g. `Vec<From>` can be treated as
/// `Vec<To>` in _O(1)_. If such an instance is available,
/// you can use [`coerce`] to perform the conversion.
///
/// Importantly, you must make sure Rust does not change the type representation
/// between the different types (typically using a `repr` directive),
/// and it must be safe for the `From` to be treated as `To`, namely same (or less restrictive) alignment,
/// no additional invariants, value can be dropped as `To`.
///
/// One use of `Coerce` is around newtype wrappers:
///
/// ```
/// use gazebo::coerce::{Coerce, coerce};
/// #[repr(transparent)]
/// #[derive(Debug, Coerce)]
/// struct Wrapper(String);
///
/// let value = vec![Wrapper("hello".to_owned()), Wrapper("world".to_owned())];
/// assert_eq!(
///     coerce::<_, &Vec<String>>(&value).join(" "),
///     "hello world"
/// );
/// let mut value = coerce::<_, Vec<String>>(value);
/// assert_eq!(value.pop(), Some("world".to_owned()));
/// ```
///
/// Another involves containers:
///
/// ```
/// use gazebo::coerce::{Coerce, coerce};
/// # #[derive(Coerce)]
/// # #[repr(transparent)]
/// # struct Wrapper(String);
/// #[derive(Coerce)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct Container<T>(i32, T);
///
/// let value = Container(20, Wrapper("twenty".to_owned()));
/// assert_eq!(
///     coerce::<_, &Container<String>>(&value).1,
///     "twenty"
/// );
/// ```
///
/// If you only need [`coerce`] on newtype references,
/// then the [`ref-cast` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ref-cast)
/// provides that, along with automatic derivations (no `unsafe` required).

/// [`Eq`], [`PartialEq`], [`Ord`] and [`PartialOrd`] traits must give identical results
/// on the `From` and `To` values.

/// This trait is mostly expected to be a requirement for the keys of associative-map
