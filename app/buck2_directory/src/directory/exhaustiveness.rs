/// Whether a directory is a complete listing of its contents within the entire build graph.
///
/// Roughly speaking:
///  - Usually, this is non-exhaustive. In most cases when we have an action input directory with an
///    entry at, say, `a/b/c`, we don't know whether there may also be an artifact defined at
///    `a/b/d` (and just not included in the directory).
///  - This is exhaustive basically only in the cases where it's inside a directory artifact, which
///    we know we've constructed exhaustively.
///
/// Almost nothing in buck needs this - for example, when we send actions to RE or the AC,
/// directories just are what they are.
///
/// However it is information that we need to retain because we need it in the materializer. In
/// particular, if the materializer sees `a/b/c`, it needs to know whether to delete the
/// pre-existing `a/b/d` or not.

/// Identity of a directory tree's exhaustiveness marking.
///
/// Every fingerprinted directory carries an [`Exhaustiveness`] marking. The marking is
/// deliberately **not** part of the fingerprint: RE, the CAS, action digests, and all
/// serialized wire formats see identical bytes regardless of marking. Instead, a directory's
/// in-memory identity is the *pair* of its fingerprint and this hash: everything that means
/// "same directory" (equality, interning, merge short-circuits) must compare both. A single
/// bit alongside the fingerprint would not suffice for identity, because marking differences
/// deep in a tree are invisible in ancestor fingerprints — so this is a recursive hash over
/// the subtree's marking, a (cheap) second merkle parallel to the fingerprint.
///
/// The encoding:
/// - Bit 0 is the node's own flag: `1` = exhaustive.
/// - `0x1` means *uniformly exhaustive*: this node and every directory below it are
///   exhaustive. This is the normal state of content trees.
/// - `0x0` means *uniformly non-exhaustive*: this node and every directory below it are
///   non-exhaustive. This is the normal state of scaffolding, e.g. an assembled input tree
///   whose artifacts are all files.
/// - Anything else is `(mix << 1) | flag`, where `mix` is a non-zero hash of the direct
///   dir-children's `ExhaustivenessHash`es in entry order.
///
/// Two properties make this sound. Comparisons only ever matter between directories of equal
/// fingerprint, which therefore have identical shape: the two sentinel values each fully
/// determine the marking of the whole subtree, and in the mixed case, pairing dir-children
/// positionally (leaves contribute nothing) compares complete markings. And a mixed hash can
/// never equal a sentinel, because `mix` is forced non-zero.
///
/// Distinct markings of one content tree could in principle collide in the 64-bit mix. That
/// requires two coexisting marking-variants of the *same* tree (in practice a handful exist
/// per tree, ever) to collide, and the consequence is bounded to applying the wrong deletion
/// boundary — never wrong content. We accept those odds.
