/// The queue is unbounded. Dropping writes on a full bounded queue would be consistent with losing
/// them being harmless, but it does not generalize: `clear` relies on its `Clear` reaching the
/// writer, since dropping that one leaves rows on disk that a later session would serve after the
/// user explicitly invalidated them. Bounding therefore needs one discipline for `Insert`/`Delete`
/// and another for `Clear`/`Flush`, and batching several rows into one transaction needs the `Flush`
/// acknowledgement to stay behind the rows it covers. `dep_file_db_queue_size` is reported per
/// snapshot so a queue that does grow is visible before either is built.
///
/// Reads do not wait for queued writes. They do not need to: the in-memory cache is consulted before
/// this store and already holds anything just written, and an entry read before its queued delete
/// lands is still re-validated against the action's digests before use.
///
/// They do run synchronously on the calling (async) thread, so a read that waits parks a runtime
/// worker. Readers take connections of their own, which is what WAL's concurrent readers need: a
/// read does not wait on the transaction a write holds. The connection is released before rows are
