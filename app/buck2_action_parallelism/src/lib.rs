//! Shared computation for buck2 action-parallelism (concurrency distribution).
//!
//! Given the action-execution events of a single build invocation, this computes
//! the distribution of how many actions were *executing* concurrently over the
//! course of the build, summarised as percentiles plus a time-weighted average.
//!
//! "Execution-only" semantics: an action is considered in flight only during its
//! actual execution window `[metadata.start_time, start_time + execution_time]`,
//! excluding queue and cache-check time. Actions served from cache (which do not
//! execute) are excluded entirely.
//!
//! This module is consumed by both the client-side `InvocationRecorder` (which
//! computes the distribution live and emits it on the `InvocationRecord`) and the
//! offline backfill binary (which recomputes it from a decoded `.pb.zst` event
//! log), so the two paths produce identical numbers. It operates on
//! `buck2_data::ActionExecutionEnd`.
