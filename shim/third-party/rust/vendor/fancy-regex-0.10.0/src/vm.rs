//! Backtracking VM for implementing fancy regexes.
//!
//! Read <https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html> for a good introduction for how this works.
//!
//! The VM executes a sequence of instructions (a program) against an input string. It keeps track
//! of a program counter (PC) and an index into the string (IX). Execution can have one or more
//! threads.
//!
//! One of the basic instructions is `Lit`, which matches a string against the input. If it matches,
//! the PC advances to the next instruction and the IX to the position after the matched string.
//! If not, the current thread is stopped because it failed.
//!
//! If execution reaches an `End` instruction, the program is successful because a match was found.
//! If there are no more threads to execute, the program has failed to match.
//!
//! A very simple program for the regex `a`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0: Lit("a")
//! 1: End
//! ```
//!
//! The `Split` instruction causes execution to split into two threads. The first thread is executed
//! with the current string index. If it fails, we reset the string index and resume execution with
//! the second thread. That is what "backtracking" refers to. In order to do that, we keep a stack
//! of threads (PC and IX) to try.
//!
//! Example program for the regex `ab|ac`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0: Split(1, 4)
//! 1: Lit("a")
//! 2: Lit("b")
//! 3: Jmp(6)
//! 4: Lit("a")
//! 5: Lit("c")
//! 6: End
//! ```
//!
//! The `Jmp` instruction causes execution to jump to the specified instruction. In the example it
//! is needed to separate the two threads.
//!
//! Let's step through execution with that program for the input `ac`:
//!
//! 1. We're at PC 0 and IX 0
//! 2. `Split(1, 4)` means we save a thread with PC 4 and IX 0 for trying later
//! 3. Continue at `Lit("a")` which matches, so we advance IX to 1
//! 4. `Lit("b")` doesn't match at IX 1 (`"b" != "c"`), so the thread fails
//! 5. We continue with the previously saved thread at PC 4 and IX 0 (backtracking)
//! 6. Both `Lit("a")` and `Lit("c")` match and we reach `End` -> successful match (index 0 to 2)
