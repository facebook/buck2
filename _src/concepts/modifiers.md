title: Configuration modifiers

Modifiers (also referred to as configuration modifiers) are a feature that lets
users add [constraints](../../rule_authors/configurations) to individual
directories, target definitions and individual `buck2` invocations. They are the
recommended to customize build configuration.

## (Open-Source Only) Getting started with modifiers

To add support for modifiers in your project, simply call `set_cfg_constructor`
in your root `PACKAGE` file. Note this is not needed internally as modifiers are
already enabled with all the right paramaters.

See the [dedicated how-to](../../users/how_tos/modifiers_setup) for more
information.

## Per-`PACKAGE` modifiers

Modifiers can be specified in `PACKAGE` files. A per-PACKAGE modifier all
targets in the directory of that PACKAGE file. For example, a modifier specified
in `foo/PACKAGE` will cover all targets in `foo/...` and all targets in
`foo/bar/...`.

See the [dedicated how-to](../../users/how_tos/modifiers_package) for more
information.

## Per-target modifiers

Modifiers can be added to individual targets. See the
[dedicated how-to](../../users/how_tos/modifiers_target) for more information.

## CLI modifiers

Modifiers can be specified on the CLI to build a target with a specific
constraint. For example, this can be used to build a target with a non-default
compiler, or to run a test using a specific sanitizer.

See the [dedicated how-to](../../users/how_tos/modifiers_cli) for more
information.

## More information

Official documentation on modifiers is sparse at the moment, so you might be
interested in reading [the original RFC](../rfcs/cfg-modifiers/modifiers.pdf)
for more details.
