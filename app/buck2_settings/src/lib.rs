//! Typed Buck settings: the configuration buck2 core reads about itself,
//! replacing the buckconfig keys it used to read. Values come from
//! `.bucksettings.toml` files, the wrapper's rollout cache, and `--setting`;
//! every key is declared in this crate with its type, defaults, scope, and
//! override policy, and nothing here is readable from Starlark.

// The declaration macro refers to this crate by name, including from here.
