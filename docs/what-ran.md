# Finding commands that Buck2 ran

Buck2 logs all the commands it runs, so after you run a build, you can query Buck2 to get access to the exact command it used.

To do so, do your build as normal, then run `buck2 log what-ran`.

## What Ran Output Format

This will output a table showing all the command that were executed, and how they were executed. The structure is as follows:

```
REASON  <TAB> TARGET <TAB> IDENTIFIER <TAB> EXECUTOR <TAB> REPRODUCER
```

Read this as follows:

- The reason will be "build" or "test", respectively for building a thing or running a test.
- The target is the name of the build target that declared an action.
- The identifier depends on the target but it will usually be something like a file name or a module.
- The executor is either `cache`, `re` or `local`.
- The reproducer is how you can re-run this yourself.

## Using What Ran Output

Use it as follows:

- Start by identifying the command you're looking for.
  - You can grep the output for a given target.
  - You can then grep by identifier if necessary. For example, if you're after C++ compilation, try grepping for the basename of your file (e.g. for `fbcode/my/stuff.cpp`, grep for `stuff.cpp`).
- Once you found it, reproduce as follows:
  - If the executor was `local`, the command is in the output, so just run it. It's expected that you'll do this from the root of your project (use `buck2 root --kind project` to find where that is).
  - If the executor was `re` or `cache`, you're provided a RE digest of the form `HASH:SIZE`. Run `frecli cas download-action HASH:SIZE` to retrieve the action, then follow the instructions to run it.


## Examples

This ran locally:

```
build  fbcode//scripts/torozco/getenv:getenv-san-conf-__generated-lib__ (archive_thin libgetenv-san-conf-__generated-lib__.pic.a)  local  fbcode/third-party-buck/platform010/build/llvm-fb/bin/llvm-ar qcsTD buck-out/v2/gen/fbcode/d839c731f5505c62/scripts/torozco/getenv/__getenv-san-conf-__generated-lib____/libgetenv-san-conf-__generated-lib__.pic.a buck-out/v2/gen/fbcode/d839c731f5505c62/scripts/torozco/getenv/__getenv-san-conf-__generated-lib____/__objects__/san-conf.c.pic.o
```

To repro, you'd run:

```
fbcode/third-party-buck/platform010/build/llvm-fb/bin/llvm-ar qcsTD buck-out/v2/gen/fbcode/d839c731f5505c62/scripts/torozco/getenv/__getenv-san-conf-__generated-lib____/libgetenv-san-conf-__generated-lib__.pic.a buck-out/v2/gen/fbcode/d839c731f5505c62/scripts/torozco/getenv/__getenv-san-conf-__generated-lib____/__objects__/san-conf.c.pic.
```

This ran on RE:

```
build  fbcode//common/init:kill (cxx_compile Kill.cpp (pic))  re  97feca9d014155a80ec55fe27e6bb17f9d2f8574:94
```

To repro, you'd run:

```
frecli cas download-action 97feca9d014155a80ec55fe27e6bb17f9d2f8574:94
```

## Expired Digests

Note that if the action was a cache hit on RE, you might get an error when downloading it indicating that it's not found. If that happens, that's because the cache entry is there but the inputs expired.

We plan to fix this, but if it happens to you, force your build to run uncached by setting an isolation dir (`buck2 --isolation-dir=$SomeRandomString build $TARGET`), then follow the instructions again. Make sure you pass the same isolation dir when you run `buck2 log whatran`.
