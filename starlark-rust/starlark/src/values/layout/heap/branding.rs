//! Documentation-only module to provide an overview of branding in starlark.
//!
//! The lifetimes of starlark values are tied to the lifetimes of a heap that they are allocated in.
//! Starlark uses branded accesses to the heap to ensure that starlark values cannot escape the
//! lifetime of the heap they're tied to, without needing to reference count access to the heap on
//! each starlark value. This module explains how that works.
//!
//! The most important factor in understanding branding is understanding the `'v` lifetime that
//! appears on `Value<'v>`, `Heap<'v>`, and similar types. Unusually, this lifetime should not be
//! understood as representing the "object lifetime" of the heap in a traditional sense. Instead,
//! the `'v` lifetime functions as a unique identifier of a particular heap. In other words, the
//! contract is that if there are two `Value<'v>`s for the same `'v`, the values are allocated in
//! the same heap.
//!
//! To see how this works in practice, it's best to consider an example of how this might fail.
//! Consider code like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! # use crate::values::Heap;
//! # use crate::values::Value;
//! # use crate::values::tuple::AllocTuple;
//! Heap::temp(|heap1| {
//!     Heap::temp(|heap2| {
//!         let s1: Value<'_> = heap1.alloc_str("abc").to_value();
//!         let v: Value<'_> = heap2.alloc(AllocTuple([s1]));
//!     })
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! This code attempts to first allocate a string value in `heap1` and then allocate a value in
//! `heap2` that references that value. This is an example of the exact kind of "cross-heap
//! confusion" that we want to disallow, and indeed this fails to compile (though the error message
//! is unfortunately not super helpful):
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0521]: borrowed data escapes outside of closure
//!   --> fbcode/buck2/starlark-rust/starlark/src/values/layout/heap/branding.rs:55:32
//!    |
//! 52 |     Heap::temp(|heap1| {
//!    |                 -----
//!    |                 |
//!    |                 `heap1` is a reference that is only valid in the closure body
//!    |                 has type `Heap<'1>`
//! ...
//! 55 |             let v: Value<'_> = heap2.alloc(AllocTuple([s1]));
//!    |                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//!    |                                |
//!    |                                `heap1` escapes the closure body here
//!    |                                argument requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`
//! ```
//!
//! ### Implementation
//!
//! "Branding" is a searchable term that will yield lots of online discussion about how to make use
//! of this pattern, but in general implementing this behavior consists of only two parts:
//!
//!  1. `Value<'v>`, `Heap<'v>`, and all similar types must be invariant in `'v`. This ensures that
//!     it's never possible to convert a `Value<'v1>` to a `Value<'v2>`.
//!  2. The "root" of all accesses to heaps must be via "branded closures" like `F: for<'v>
//!     FnOnce(Heap<'v>)`, essentially functions with signatures similar to `Heap::temp`.
//!
//! That's it; combined, this means that user code can never prove that the `'v1` coming from one
//! branded closure is the same as the `'v2` coming from another.
//!
//! ### References to frozen heaps
//!
//! To support references to values in frozen heaps, we expand the above contract somewhat. Instead
//! of requiring that a `Value<'v>` must be allocated in a `Heap<'v>`, we require that it must be
//! allocated in a `Heap<'v>` *or in any frozen heap that the `Heap<'v>` depends on.*
//!
//! From the perspective of object lifetimes this is obviously sane (the `Heap<'v>` will keep the
//! dependent frozen heaps alive). We make use of the expanded contract by then providing an API
//! like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! impl<T: IsStaticType> OwnedFrozen<T> {
//!     pub fn add_to_heap<'v>(self, heap: Heap<'v>) -> T::Reinfect<'v>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `add_to_heap` adds the heap the frozen value is associated with as a dependency of the passed
//! heap, and then hands the value back at `'v`; the `'v` lifetime in the return value essentially
//! acts as a proof/endorsement that the given value is sound to use "within the context of that
//! heap."
//!
//! ### Heap edges
//!
//! `add_to_heap` is the common case of a more general tool. A `HeapEdge<'v, 'dep>` is a witness
//! that the heap of `'v` keeps the heap of `'dep` alive, and its `rebrand` converts anything at
//! `'dep` to `'v`. Edges are only minted where that dependency is established:
//!
//!  - `OwnedFrozenReconstructor::edge` and `frozen_edge`, inside `by_ref_with_reconstructor`,
//!    add the owner as a reference of the given heap and return the edge to it.
//!  - `Module::frozen_heap` (and `Evaluator::frozen_heap`) opens a scope on a module's own frozen
//!    heap and provides the edge from the module's value heap to it; the dependency is
//!    structural, see `ModuleHeaps`.
//!  - `HeapEdge::immortal` is the edge from every heap to the `'static` brand, at which only
//!    immortal data exists: statics, and the `Methods` tables reached through `&'static Methods`.
//!    `at()` on the static holders is this edge behind a name.
//!  - `HeapEdge::identity` is the edge from a heap to itself, for code written against two brands
//!    that is handed one heap for both.
//!
//! `HeapEdge::unchecked_new` is `unsafe` and crate-private; these minters are its only callers.
//!
//! ### Brands are higher-ranked
//!
//! Every brand at which a heap handle exists (`Heap<'v>`, `FrozenHeap<'fh>`, and the `Module`,
//! `Evaluator`, `Freezer` and deserialize context built on one) is introduced by a closure that
//! is generic over it: `Heap::temp`, `Module::with_temp_heap`, `OwnedFrozenHeap::with`,
//! `OwnedFrozen::build` and `by_ref`, `Module::frozen_heap`, `ModuleHeaps::seal_with`,
//! `StarlarkDeserializerImpl::recover_from_pagable`. Inside such a closure `'v` is arbitrary (it
//! may as well be `'static`), so a borrow of anything that is not `'static` can never unify with
//! it: `module.set("x", owned.as_ref().value())` does not compile, and `add_to_heap`, which
//! records the dependency, is the way in. Only `'static` owners can lend values at a live brand,
//! and those are immortal. It follows that every frozen `Value<'v>` was minted by an edge (the
//! module's own `HeapEdge<'v, 'fm>`, an `add_to_heap`, `HeapEdge::immortal`) or read out of a
//! value that was. Keep the property: never add a constructor of a heap handle from a plain
//! borrow.
//!
//! `OwnedFrozenRef<'f, T>` hands values out at the borrow `'f`. That is a brand without a heap
//! handle: nothing can be allocated at it and everything at it is frozen, so no cross-heap
//! pointer can be created there.
//!
//! ### The seal edge
//!
//! A module's optimizer evaluates speculatively at the value heap's `'v` and folds frozen results
//! into IR allocated at the module's frozen heap `'fm`. No `HeapEdge` points that way, but a
//! `SealEdge<'fm, 'v>` does, for frozen values only: it certifies that the frozen heap references
//! every heap in which a frozen `Value<'v>` can live, and its `rebrand` is `OptCtx::demote`.
//! `ModuleHeaps` mints it beside the `HeapEdge`, on a proof in three steps: (a) by the previous
//! section, a frozen `Value<'v>` was minted by the module's own `HeapEdge` (so lives in the
//! frozen heap or in a heap it references), by an `add_to_heap` (which adds the value's heap to
//! the value heap's references first), or from `'static` data, or was read out of such a value,
//! and a value only points into heaps its own heap references; (b) the value heap's references
//! are the frozen heap's at every instant, the two sharing one set; (c) `'static` data is
//! immortal. The one assumption is the contract this module opens with, which every allocator
//! enforces through its brand.
//!
//! ### What is trusted rather than proven
//!
//! One brand change has no edge behind it. It rests on a contract stated at the site, and it is
//! the only place where a brand is only as good as the code that minted it:
//!
//!  - `Freezer::freeze`'s already-frozen fast path (values/layout/heap/freezer.rs). A value that
//!    is already frozen is handed back at `'fv` without being copied. The contract is on
//!    `Freezer::new`: the target heap references every heap the value can live in.
//!    `ModuleHeaps::seal_with` is its one production caller, by privacy, and its builder shares
//!    the value heap's references, so the seal edge's proof covers every value of the module;
//!    but `freeze` is generic over the brand of its input, so a `FreezeBranded` impl can hand it
//!    a value borrowed from an unrelated owner, which no edge covers. Tests construct freezers
//!    whose heaps are scoped within the test.
//!
//! Everything else that hands out a brand records the dependency it certifies, and the
//! `'static` brand is honest: apart from the private erased storage of the owning carriers
//! (`OwnedFrozen`, `FrozenModule`, `Globals`) and of the frozen heaps themselves, which the
//! freezer and the pagable deserializer fill at a brand and which is only ever read back at a
//! brand the owner vouches for, the only data at `'static` is immortal.
