# Buck2 User Guide

Welcome to Buck2! A successor to [Buck](https://buck.build). Buck2 is largely compatible with Buck, so start typing `buck2` today.

## Communication channels

* [Buck2 prototyping](https://fb.workplace.com/groups/buck2prototyping) - where we have discussions about what features Buck2 should have, how it's going, status updates etc.
* [Buck2 users](https://fb.workplace.com/groups/buck2users) - questions from users, reports of bugs.
* [Buck2 rule authors](https://fb.workplace.com/groups/347532827186692) - discussions around specific language rules, e.g. C++.
* [Buck2 oncall](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/monitor/oncall_profile?oncall=buck2) - urgent tasks and escalation.

## Specialised groups

We have both Workplace groups, associated chat channels and task tags for various projects. Most task folders are _not monitored_, so post all questions and bug reports to a group.
