// * It's possible to propagate stack depth across external functions like

// * We need to guarantee that stack depth is not lost in complex invocation
//   chains like function calls compare which calls native function which calls
//   starlark function which calls to_str. We could change all evaluation stack
//   signatures to accept some "context" parameters, but passing it as
//   thread-local is easier.
