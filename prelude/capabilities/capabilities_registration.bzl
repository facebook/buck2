Capabilities registration provider and tset for build graph propagation.

CapabilitiesRegistrationInfo is a provider that carries capability metadata
through the dependency graph via a transitive set (tset). Each library with
capability declarations creates a tset entry and merges it with its deps'
tsets. At binary build time, a manifest rule projects the final tset into
a support manifest JSON.
