"""
Applies the merge sequence to the linkable_graph and module graph to produce merged libraries.

The merge sequence is a list of "merge entries". Each entry is comprised of "merge specs", each of which have a name and
a list of roots. A merge entry may be a merge spec or a list of merge specs.

For example:

```
[
    ("libgroup1.so", [//group1:root1, //group1:root2]),
    ("libgroup2.so", [//group2:root]),
    (
        ("libgroup3lib1.so": [//group3:root1]),
        ("libgroup3lib2.so": [//group3:root2]),
    ),
    ...
]
```

We use this sequence to assign each target in the linkable graph to a "merge group". The list is processed in order and
each entry defines a new merge group. That group consists of all the roots in the entry and all of the transitive
dependencies of those roots, except for nodes that have already been assigned a merge group.

We then need to split that merge group into "split groups" for four reasons: avoiding unwanted dependencies between
libraries, defining valid libraries, avoiding adding implicit module dependencies to targets, and excluding targets that
shouldn't be merged. That imposes these constraints:
1. Libraries defined by specs in the same entry should not depend on one another, so any shared dependencies must be
   split into separate libraries.
2. Targets in a split group will all be in the same module. A library cannot span multiple modules.
3. For split groups in the root module, all targets will have the same set of transitive module dependencies (including
   through targets in other merge groups). A non-root module cannot be loaded without loading all of its module
   dependencies, but if a JNI entry-point target is in the root module and has module dependencies, those dependencies
   would have to be loaded explicitly in advance, or the library load for the target will fail. Making any such target
   depend on *more* modules in merged-library builds would therefore risk merged-build-only runtime crashes.
4. Some targets are excluded from merging (explicitly via a blocklist, or implicitly because they cannot be packaged as
   assets). Non-asset targets are rare, often cause issues when merged, and complicate split-group "layering" as
   described below, so it significantly simplifies merge sequence configuration and mechanics to exclude them.

Finally, we need to prevent dependency cycles between merged libraries. This only requires additional effort at the
split group level; there cannot be any cycles between merge groups because, by definition, any transitive dependency of
a target in a previous merge group is already in a previous merge group.

To ensure there are no cycles, we further split the split groups into "layers" by how many times their dependents in the
current merge group reenter the same split group. There cannot be a cycle between any pair of split group layers,
regardless of whether the layers are from the same split group. If dependency chains exist in both directions between
two split group layers:
- The layers must share the same transitive module dependencies.
- The layers must have different dependent reentry counts or be in different modules, or else they'd be the same layer.
- If the layers are in the same module, there are dependency chains in both directions between different layers of the
  same split group. But those layers have different dependent reentry counts into that split group, so this is
  impossible. The layers are in different modules.
- One layer must be in the root module, or else there would be a module dependency cycle. (As a special case, cycles
  between the root module and non-root modules are allowed.)
- Every target in the root-module layer in the dependency chain starting from the non-root module layer must be a
  non-asset target, or else the module would have included each such target, since they're transitive dependencies and
  no other non-root module includes them.
- But we do not merge non-asset targets. There is no cycle.

Further, the number of layers in a split group is the minimal number of libraries that can be merged from that split
group without causing a cycle. There exists a dependency chain between each pair of layers in a split group that exits
the split group at one layer and reenters it at the other, so any library merging two layers of the same split group
transitively depends on itself.

The split group layering determines the final library constituents.

We perform a bottom-up traversal to identify transitive module dependencies, then a top-down traversal to assign split
groups, compute dependent split-group reentry counts, and finalize split group layers. While we could avoid the second
traversal by instead layering based on *dependency* reentry count, using *dependent* reentry count produces better
target distribution between layers.
- Optimal target distribution would maximize the number of targets in the largest layer. For a fixed number of
  libraries, build size varies depending on how many symbols need to be exposed in order to facilitate linkage across
  libraries, and so reducing the number of satellite targets will in general improve build size.
- Split-group-reentrant dependency chains are rare, so targets without split-group-reentrant dependencies or dependents
  are common. Similarly, short split-group-reentrant dependency chains are more common than longer ones.
- So if we want to maximize the size of the largest layer, we want the targets without reentrant dependencies to merge
  with the targets at the heads of reentrant dependency chains, the most common targets in such chains.

Once we've done the split group layering, the split group and layer identify the "final library" for each target. The
one remaining thing to do is to produce a name for each final library. Ideally, each merge group will end up with a
single library and the naming is simple. If it ends up having multiple libraries, we give each a unique name by adding
suffixes.

We aim to minimize the suffixing of the largest, most central layers, so we apply the following rules:
1. Library names start with the names of the merge specs from the current entry whose roots include or depend on the
   library's targets. This is just the spec name if there is only one, or `lib_shared_` plus the underscore-separated
   list of spec names if there are multiple.
2. If a merge spec includes targets from multiple modules, each library in a non-root module will be suffixed with that
   module name.
3. We perform a topological traversal of the final library graph, maintaining counters of times we've encountered each
   (possibly module-suffixed) library name. Each final library after the first encountered for its library name will be
   further suffixed with that library name's counter value.
