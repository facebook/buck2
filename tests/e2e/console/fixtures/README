Those are fixtures used for CLI tests. The idea is to not regenerate them very
often, we should only need to do this when our daemon / cli protocol changes.

Those fixtures are event logs, so they should be possible to re-generate by
just re-running the corresponding build.

Regenerate `my_genrule0` using, from the `buck2` path:

```
rm "$(hg root)/fbcode/buck2/tests/e2e/console/fixtures/my_genrule0.proto" && \
./buck2.sh build fbcode//buck2/tests/targets/rules/genrule:my_genrule0 && \
./buck2.sh kill && \
./buck2.sh build fbcode//buck2/tests/targets/rules/genrule:my_genrule0 --event-log "$(hg root)/fbcode/buck2/tests/e2e/console/fixtures/my_genrule0.proto"
```

(this runs Buck twice to ensure we get a cache hit)
