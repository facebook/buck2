//!
//! A 'target' is an instance of a rule declared in the build file. Each
//! 'target' is a node on the 'static graph'. Targets are determined by parsing;
//! no extra analysis or building is necessary to determine the 'target's
//! available.
//!
//! For example, the below is a target, defined in some 'Package' with the given
//! name "foo".
//!
//!```ignored
//! java_library(
//!    name = "foo",
//!    srcs = [ ... ],
//!    ...
//! )
//! ```
//!
//! Target names are limited to non-empty alpha numeric characters `,`, `=`,
//! `-`, `/`, and `_`. No other special characters, e.g. spaces, are allowed.
//! Currently, `+` is allow for backwards compatibility but may be removed.
//!
//! 'TargetLabel's are labels/keys that uniquely map to a 'target' in the static
//! graph. These are of the form `<cell>//<path to build file>:<target name>`.
//! e.g. `mycell//my/package/path:my_target`, where `mycell` is the cell,
//! `my/package/path` is the package, and `my_target` is the target name
//! belonging to the package.
