Usage: buck2 audit [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  cell                           Query information about the [cells] list in .buckconfig.
  file-package                   Map file paths to fully qualified package names.
  classpath                      Prints out a target's classpaths if it has one.
                                     This command is deprecated and currently available for
                                     compatibility with buck1.
                                     We will replace this command with something that can audit the
                                     entire `TemplatePlaceholderInfo` in the future.
  config                         buck audit config
  configurations                 prints the constraints for configuration IDs
  includes                       list build file extensions imported at parse time.
  prelude                        print the interpreter prelude to stdout
  providers                      prints out the providers for a target pattern
  subtargets                     Print all subtargets
  analysis-queries               buck audit analysis resolving query attrs
  execution-platform-resolution  prints out information about execution platform resolution
  visibility                     Verify the visibility for transitive deps of the specified
                                 target(s) on the unconfigured target graph
  starlark                       Debug Starlark interpreter
  dep-files                      prints out the select files for a command
  deferred-materializer          Access and interact with the deferred materializer
  output                         Query the action that produced the output artifact. Does not
                                 support BXL, test, scratch, or anon artifacts. If the configuration
                                 hash of the output path does not match the current platform
                                 configuration, the unconfigured target label will be returned.
  parse                          Parses the buck-out path into parts that may be useful (ex: config
                                 hash, file path to artifact).
  package-values                 Inspect package values
  help                           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [env: BUCK_VERBOSE=]
          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
