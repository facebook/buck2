                 below), which changes that configuration. Running it invalidates cached parsing \
                 and analysis results, and the next command that passes those arguments again pays \
                 that cost again. If the change is not needed, add `--reuse-current-config` to keep \
                 the current configuration (this ignores the command's config arguments).\n\n\
