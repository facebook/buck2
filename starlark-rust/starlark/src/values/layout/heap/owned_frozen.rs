/// `'static` in a type like `OwnedFrozen<Value<'static>>` stands in for the brand of that heap,
/// which has no name, and no accessor hands the value back at `'static`:
///
/// * [`add_to_heap`](OwnedFrozen::add_to_heap) records the owning heap as a reference of the
///   given heap and hands the value back at that heap's brand. This is what you want nearly all
///   of the time.
/// * [`by_ref`](OwnedFrozen::by_ref) runs a closure on the value at a brand `'fv` private to the
///   closure, so nothing derived from it can escape;
///   [`by_ref_with_reconstructor`](OwnedFrozen::by_ref_with_reconstructor) also provides an
///   `OwnedFrozenReconstructor`, which re-pairs derived values with the owner or mints a
///   [`HeapEdge`].
/// * [`map`](OwnedFrozen::map), [`try_map`](OwnedFrozen::try_map) and
///   [`maybe_map`](OwnedFrozen::maybe_map) produce an `OwnedFrozen<U>` of the same heap.
/// * [`as_ref`](OwnedFrozen::as_ref) borrows the owner as an [`OwnedFrozenRef`], which uses the
///   borrow as the brand and hands the value out directly.

/// it, and offers only the heap-identity API (`name`, `refs`, the size accessors). It compares and
/// hashes by heap identity. Sealing an [`OwnedFrozenHeap`] produces one, see
/// [`OwnedFrozenHeap::seal`], and it is the currency of [`Heap::add_reference`] and
