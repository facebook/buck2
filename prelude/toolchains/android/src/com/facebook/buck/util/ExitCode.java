/**
 * ExitCode class defines Buck binary protocol, i.e. exit codes that Buck can report to a running
 * shell. In addition to exit codes defined below, we have to honor following conventions.
 *
 * <p>Buck bootstrapper must conform to the protocol, i.e. properly implement FATAL_BOOTSTRAP
 *
 * <p>Exit codes for interrupts do follow POSIX convention, i.e. 128 + SIGNAL_CODE, i.e SIGINT is
 * returned as 128 + 2 = 130
 *
 * <p>Exit codes 1-9 are reserved for non-fatal errors, like build errors
 *
 * <p>Exit codes 10-19 are reserved for fatal errors, like unexpected runtime exceptions
 *
 * <p>Binary protocol is open to extension but closed to modification.
