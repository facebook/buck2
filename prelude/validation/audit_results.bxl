    # `with_inputs = True` so we can be sure that we materialize the the paths to validation
    # outputs with the JSON.
    #
    # Unfortunately, `ensured_artifact_group` has a limited API that doesn't allow us to
    # only print a subset of the targets. While you can loop thru them, there is no way .owner
    # API, you'd have to guess based on filepath.
    #
    # As a result, we ensure the artifacts as we iterate so we can get the materialized absolute
    # path and not run into an invariant where you are not allowed to freeze EnsuredArtifacts.
