# Contributing to Buck2

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

Buck2 is currently developed in Meta's internal repositories. Code that is
developed internally gets reviewed, sent through CI, committed, and then
automatically mirrored out to GitHub every 15 minutes. Code that arrives through
a PR is reviewed by a Meta developer on GitHub, then once accepted, moved into
our internal workflow where it is reviewed, sent through CI, committed and added
to the repo. We maintain both external CI (the results of which are visible on
GitHub) and a more thorough internal CI (building internal projects etc). Alas,
our full test suite is not yet mirrored to the open source repo, but we hope to
fix that in due course.
