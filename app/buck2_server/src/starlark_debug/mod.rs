//! Provides the (daemon-side) support for buck2's starlark debugging.
//!
//! Components of the debugger:
//!
//! [BuckStarlarkDebuggerServer] is the main way that the core of buck2 integrates
//! the starlark debugger. This provides the hooks to wrap a Starlark evaluation and
//! enable the debugger (and handle communication between that starlark evaluation
//! and the debugger server/state)
//!
//! [BuckStarlarkDebuggerHandle] is a "handle" the to the debugger server. One of these
//! will be created for each buck2 command and put in the dice per-transaction data. Code
//! that needs to do starlark evaluation can then use this to setup their Evaluator
//! appropriately (though this is really just an implementation detail hidden in the
//! helper [buck2_interpreter::dice::starlark_provider::with_starlark_eval_provider]).
//!
//! [CURRENT_DEBUGGER] holds a global reference for the currently attached debugger and
//! vends out handles (through [create_debugger_handle]).
//!
//! ServerState the internal implementation of the starlark debugger server sends all
//! requests and starlark evaluation events to the single-threaded ServerState.
//!
//! Information about the debugger behavior:
//!
//! The debugger server exposes all current starlark evaluations as separate threads to
//! the DAP client. Then, one of it's main responsibility is as a mux/demux for requests/events/etc
//! flowing between the DAP client and the starlark evaluation.
//!
//! The server also tracks the state of all evaluations so that it can send regularly
//! debugger snapshots to all current buck commands. Those commands in turn use those snapshots
//! to render a debugger superconsole component so that users aren't left confused about
//! why their commands are seemingly hanging.
//!
//! The server handles a variety of other small adapter functionality. For example,
//! the DAP client may send source file references as absolute paths, but our starlark
//! evaluators will only understand them as the project-relative paths that buck
//! uses and so the server must convert them from/to the client/starlark.
