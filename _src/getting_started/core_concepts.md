In the previous tutorials, we’ve created buck files, defined a couple of buck
targets and successfully built and ran the “Hello World” rust binary and even
wrote and ran a test. Great job done! Now, let’s go through the journey again,
weaving in the core concepts as we go along to see what gets involved during
this learning process.

## Understanding Target Labels

This is one of the most important concepts to understand when using Buck2. It is
a precise way to identify any buildable unit in your codebase.

In the tutorials, you encountered the following target label like
[<FbInternalOnly> `fbcode//scripts/<unixname>/buck2_lab/greeter_bin:main` </FbInternalOnly> <OssOnly> `root//buck2_lab/greeter_bin:main` </OssOnly>](../tutorial_adding_dependencies/#step-5-run-the-binary).

Here is the anatomy of a target label:

<FbInternalOnly>

<TargetDiagram
    cell_name="fbcode"
    pkg_name="scripts/<unixname>/buck2_lab/greeter_bin"
    target_name="main"
    cell_href="#cell"
    pkg_href="#package"
    target_href="#target-name"
/>

</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

<TargetDiagram
    cell_name="root"
    pkg_name="buck2_lab/greeter_bin"
    target_name="main"
    cell_href="#cell"
    pkg_href="#package"
    target_href="#target-name"
/>

</OssOnly>

## Cell

[Cell](../../concepts/key_concepts/#cells) defines a directory tree of one or
more buck [packages](../../concepts/key_concepts/#packages). The root of a buck
cell contains a global configuration file called
[**`.buckconfig`**](../../concepts/buckconfig).

<FbInternalOnly>

For the lab you just did, fbcode is the cell root where .buckconfig resides. If
you are developing in other projects like ARVR, android and ios, then fbsource
is the buck cell root.

#### Tips:

- Do not modify .buckconfig and do not create .buckconfig without consulting
  buck or devx team!
- Be aware that buck does enforce package boundaries, so a source file only
  belongs to its nearest BUCK file.

</FbInternalOnly>

You can run `buck2 audit cell` to inspect the abs path of each cell root.

## Package

The existence of a [BUCK file](#buck-file) ({ isInternal() ?
<code>scripts/&lt;unixname&gt;/buck2_lab/greeter_bin/BUCK</code> :
<code>buck2_lab/greeter_bin/BUCK</code> }) defines a buck
[package](../../concepts/key_concepts/#packages) { isInternal() ?
<code>scripts/&lt;unixname&gt;/buck2_lab/greeter_bin</code> :
<code>buck2_lab/greeter_bin</code> } isn't just a directory. If a buck target
uses the source file as input, that target is regarded as the **owner** of the
source.

## Target name

The name of the target in the package. It is the name we defined in the BUCK
file.

```python
rust_binary(
    name = "main",
    srcs = ["main.rs"],
    ...
)
```

It should be unique within the package.

## Buck File

In the lab, you’ve already created three
[build files](../../concepts/build_file/):

- `greeter_bin/BUCK`
- `greeter_lib/BUCK`
- `logging_lib/BUCK`

Although configurable, the name of the build file normally is just BUCK.
<FbInternalOnly> Buck file within Meta could be `BUCK` or `TARGETS` (fbcode
only)</FbInternalOnly>

In these BUCK files, you’ve written a couple of
[buck targets](../../concepts/build_target/), `:main`, `:library`,
`:logging_lib` and `:test`. Buck targets are instances of
[build rules](../../concepts/build_rule/), which defines how the target should
be built. For example, target :main is of rule type
[rust_binary](../../prelude/rules/rust/rust_binary/), the output artifact will
be a binary that’s runnable, while `:library`, `:logging_lib` are of rule type
[rust_library](../../prelude/rules/rust/rust_library/), the output of which will
be a library that can be linked to the binary.

Referring to buck targets in BUCK files and CLI commands need to follow a
special [target pattern](../../concepts/target_pattern/), which looks like:

<code>cell//path/to/dir:target</code> or <code>cell//path/to/dir/...</code>

you will soon become very familiar with these patterns during daily development.

#### Tips:

<!--  TODO: change link to buck2 doc once available for macros -->

- Buck targets can be either build rules or
  [macros](https://buck.build/extending/macros.html), which are
  wrappers/extensions around native build rules, macros are usually defined .bzl
  files. <FbInternalOnly> The `rust_binary`, `rust_library` and `rust_unittest`
  used in the lab are actually fbcode macros, not native rules as defined in this
  doc. You may notice that when we run
  [`buck2 targets`](../tutorial_first_build/#step-6-inspecting-your-target-optional)
  there are several other targets except `:main` in the outputs. These are
  defined in macros. </FbInternalOnly>
- Buck uses [starlark](../../concepts/glossary/#starlark) language which is a
  dialect of python, to define build rules and macros.

## Visualizing Your Tutorial Project

Now that we understand the basic terminology, let's visualize what you built.
We'll start with the simple file structure, then explore how Buck2 interprets
these files as packages and targets.

### File Structure Overview

Here's the complete project structure you built through the tutorials:
<FbInternalOnly> For simplicity, we show `logging_lib` as a subdirectory of
`buck2_lab` in the diagram below. </FbInternalOnly>

### From Files to Targets

### The Complete Picture

file structure, Buck2 packages, targets, and dependencies all interconnect to
form a cohesive build system:

## Load Function and Attributes

<FbInternalOnly>
You might have noticed that the first line in the main BUCK file is a load function:

<code>load("@fbsource//tools/build_defs:rust_binary.bzl", "rust_binary")</code>

Load imports the <code>rust_binary</code> macro from a rust_binary.bzl file. You
can inspect the content of it under

<code>fbsource/tools/build_defs/fbcode_macros/build_defs/rust_binary.bzl </code>

using the right rule/macro is the first step for a successful build.
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

Some buck file starts with one or more load functions, which load macros from
.bzl files for this buck file to use, this is similar to load or include
functions in other programming languages, load function takes the following
syntax: <code>load("@cell//path/to/bzl:some_bzl.bzl", "some_macro")</code>

</OssOnly>

Each buck target has a set of attributes, which provide powerful ways to define
and customize how the build should be done, you can inspect the
[rule definition](../../prelude/rules/rust/rust_binary/) to see what these
attributes are and the syntax to define them. Some attributes are mandatory and
some are optional with defaults. Most attributes are rule-specific but there are
common ones such as `name`, `srcs`, `deps` and
[visibility](../../concepts/visibility/).

#### Tips:

- Without using load function, buck will default to using native rules with the
  same name;
- One load function can load multiple macros from the same `.bzl` file
- Deps and visibility are important attributes to understand, please read the
  docs!

<FbInternalOnly>

- Using macro is mandatory in some repos, like Fbcode.

</FbInternalOnly>

## Dependencies and Dependency Graph

<TutorialMermaidDiagram>
{`
graph TD
    A(("🎯 **:main**<br/>(rust_binary)")) --> B(("🎯 **:library**<br/>(rust_library)"))
    A --> C(("🎯 **:logging_lib**<br/>(rust_library)"))
    B --> C
    D(("🎯 **:test**<br/>(rust_test)")) --> B

    style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,stroke-width:1px
    style B fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:1px
    style C fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:1px
    style D fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b,stroke-width:1px

`} </TutorialMermaidDiagram>

As you craft your program, you may need to rely on other targets, known as
[dependencies](../../concepts/glossary/#dependency). In the "Hello World"
exercise, <code>:library</code> and <code>:logging_lib</code> targets are
dependencies of the <code>:main</code> target. One target can depend on multiple
dependencies, which in turn can have their own dependencies to form a web of
connections, a so-called
[dependency graph](../../concepts/key_concepts/#buck2s-dependency-graph), our
lab renders a very simple dependency graph with maximum depth of 2, in real
world, the graph will be much bigger and one top level target could have tens of
thousands dependencies.

Understanding and managing the dependency graph of your buck target is important
for effective development. Buck also offers powerful query tools to explore the
dependency graph.

#### Tips:

- Dependency graph size affects build speed and memory usage greatly
- The graph is a DAG graph. So cycles in the dependency graph (circular
  dependency), something like `A->B->...->X->A`, are not allowed, buck will emit
  error when cycle is detected.

## Buck Commands

In the lab, once buck and source files are in place, we use
`buck2 build :main --show-output` to build the `:main` target. This uses the
[buck build command](../../users/commands/build/) to compile and link your rust
code into a binary. Now let’s take a closer look at this command. A buck command
is usually composed of a command type ( `build`, `run`, `test` ...), some
[target pattern](../../concepts/target_pattern/), and options. Command options
can offer extra configurations to do the build.

Buck accepts multiple targets in one command, such as:

- `buck build target1 target2 target3` builds 3 targets in one command

- `buck build //path/to/dir/...` builds all targets under `path/to/dir`,
  including sub-dir

- `buck build //path/to/dir:` build all targets under package `path/to/dir`,
  without sub packages

- `buck build @a-file` builds targets listed in a-file, which is a plain text
  file

Buck builds multiple targets in parallel, unless there are dependencies between
them.

Once target is built, you can use [buck run](../../users/commands/run/),
[buck test](../../users/commands/test) and
[buck install](../../users/commands/install) to test the code.

As you become more adept, you can explore other powerful buck commands, such as:

- [`buck query`](../../users/commands/query/) with various
  [options](../../users/query/uquery/) to analyze the dependency graph, this set
  of commands is by far the most powerful and complicated buck commands to use;
- [`buck kill`](../../users/commands/kill/) to stop running
  [buck daemon](../../concepts/daemon/), this is sometimes needed to recover
  from a failed build due to bad daemon state;
- [`buck clean`](../../users/commands/clean/) to remove build artifacts from
  [buck-out](../../concepts/buck_out/), this is a remedy to recover from failed
  build due to either bad daemon or bad artifacts in cache;
- [`buck log`](../../users/commands/log/) to see information about previous
  builds
- [`buck bxl`](../../bxl/tutorial/) to run bxl scripts. BXL is a buck2 script
  language using starlark syntax to write complex query or build logic.

#### Tips:

- Buck offers help menus for all commands, try the -h option, you can buck -h or
  buck build -h to see all available commands and options

<FbInternalOnly>

- Sometimes you’ll see options like `@mode/opt` in the command, the mode file
  (path is `cell/mode/opt`) contains a set of buck configs that are extensions
  of `.buckconfig`, see some examples in
  [this wiki](https://www.internalfb.com/wiki/Buck/Buck-users/fbcode-repo/C++/running-buck-in-different-modes/)
  for C++ build mode;

</FbInternalOnly>

### Buck2 Command Flow

Here's how Buck2 commands work in your tutorial workflow:

<TutorialMermaidDiagram>
{`
graph TD
    A[User runs buck2 command] --> B{Command Type}

    B -->|build| C[buck2 build :main]
    B -->|run| D[buck2 run :main]
    B -->|test| E[buck2 test :test]

    C --> F[Parse BUCK files]
    D --> F
    E --> F

    F --> G[Resolve dependencies]
    G --> H[Execute build actions]
    H --> I[Generate outputs in </br> buck-out/]

    I --> J{Command specific behavior}
    J -->|build| K[Show output path </br> if --show-output available]
    J -->|run| L[Execute binary]
    J -->|test| M[Run tests & show results]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style H fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#fce4ec

`} </TutorialMermaidDiagram>

## Console and Output

During the lab, you’ve seen the console output during build and test process,
these outputs give information about the execution progress and state. Buck
offers different kinds of
[consoles](../../users/build_observability/interactive_console/) for various
purposes, and the interactive feature helps during debugging.

## Buck-out

So you’ve successfully built the target and run it. Finally, let’s briefly talk
about [buck-out](../../concepts/buck_out/), which is an important concept yet
hard to understand initially. We know that buck builds complicated targets with
big dependency graphs and generates tons of outputs for test and run. Where
should these output artifacts be stored at? The outputs should not be stored at
the source directory which is tracked by the source control system. The outputs
also need to be reused/cached for later builds to save build time. So here comes
buck-out,it has the following characteristics:

- It’s under repo root;
- It has a unique file structure, some directories are hashed for caching
  purpose;
- It stores a lot of data including output artifacts, buck log files, tmp data,
  etc;
- It is managed by buck and developers normally should not manipulate;

#### Tips:

- **Do NOT** delete artifacts manually from buck-out directory and expect buck
  to rebuild them, buck doesn’t track things under buck-out, use buck clean
  instead;

<FbInternalOnly>

- **Do NOT** use buck-out directory path in your source or BUCK file, you should
  not assume where artifacts will be stored, see more information in
  [this wiki](https://www.internalfb.com/wiki/Buck/Buck-users/faq_trick_tip/Dealing_with_buck-out/);
- Buck-out can grow very big and consumes your disk space, you can run buck
  clean or [buck clean --stale](../../users/commands/clean/) as the remedy

## Buck UI

Buck is mostly a command line tool but buck team does offer a
[web-based UI](../../users/build_observability/observability/#buck2s-web-ui) for
users to inspect the build afterwards. To access the UI, the simplest way is to
type “buck2” in the browser URL and it should bring you to your latest build
history. Clicking on the uuid of the build will take you to the individual
build.
