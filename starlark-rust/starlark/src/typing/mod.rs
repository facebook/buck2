// Notes:
//   We deal with list.append/list.extend/list.insert, which mutate their list argument
//   We ignore dict.setdefault/dict.update, as these are pretty complex functions
//   We consider "non-sensicle" operations like list.remove and == to have implied types that make them meaningful
//       even if they don't fail when doing something silly

//! Types required to support the [`typecheck`](crate::syntax::AstModule::typecheck) function.
