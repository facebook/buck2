# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

## Mac Setup

`yarn` and `node` are installed by default on devservers, but not on Macs. To
work on this site on Macs, add `fbsource/xplat/third-party/node/bin` and
`fbsource/third-party/yarn` to your `PATH`.

## Installation

The very first time:

```shell
$ yarn global add node-gyp
```

And if on Eden:

```shell
$ eden redirect add $PWD/node_modules bind
$ eden redirect add $PWD/build bind
```

Also on your first time, and potentially after each large rebase:

```shell
$ yarn install
```

## Building Generated Content

Again, on your first time:

```shell
$ yarn generate
```

You will need to re-run this each time you want to see changes to generated
content, primarily the API docs. You can alternatively `yarn generate_local` to
update generated content using a built-from-source buck2.

## Local Development

```shell
$ yarn start-fb
```

This command starts a local development server, and if on Mac, opens up a local
browser window.

On a devserver, the window does not open for you, but you can head to
https://devvmXX.foo.com:9094 in your browser. This requires lighthouse or VPN.

To get your changes reflected on the local server:

1.  For non-generated markdown content in the `docs/` directory, reload the
    page.
2.  For generated markdown content, re-run `yarn generate` as above and reload
    the page.
3.  For other changes to the site configuration, Ctrl+C and restart
    `yarn start`. Then, hard-reload the page (Ctrl+Shift+R).

## OSS Variants

To see the external versions of the page, do:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

If on a devserver, this will require manually setting up an SSH tunnel by
running the following **from your mac**:

```shell
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 $DEVSERVER
```

In all cases, you'll need to be either on lighthouse or VPN for this to work.

## Prod Build

You can perform a production build via `yarn build` or `yarn build-fb`. This
generates a static site into `build/`. This site can be served via any static
site viewer - docusaurus has one built in that you can run via `yarn serve`. As
of Oct 2024 this only works on Macs, not on devservers.

Iterating on the prod build is slower than on the local `yarn start` server.

## Deployment

```shell
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to
build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Fixing GitHub Security Alerts

Periodically, GitHub's security tooling will send alerts to update packages. In
some cases, the top level dependency is not yet updated, though you can address
this by
[forcing selective resolution](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).

Steps:

1. Update the package.json file's resolution section with the target version
   needed
2. `yarn install`
3. Create PR/diff with this change
