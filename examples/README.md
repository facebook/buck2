# buck2 examples

In these folders are some examples on how to get buck2 working with
your favorite languages and tools.

## prelude

Examples taking advantage of the prelude to create toolchain-independent
build definitions in cpp and python. Includes as an example a usecase
for building and using c-extension-backed python libraries.

Note: to take advantage of these examples you must symlink the prelude
into this folder.

## no_prelude

Preludeless examples for those wanting to use buck2 with their own
rules and toolchains. In here you can learn about how BUILD
files interact with rules, and how the provider abstraction can be
used to encapsulate build logic.

## toolchains

Examples testing the various toolchains included in the prelude.
