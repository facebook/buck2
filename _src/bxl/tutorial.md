In this tutorial, we will use bxl to gather and generate all the index data of a
target and its dependencies. Along the way we will cover query, analysis,
extracting information from an analysis result, running an
[action](../../concepts/glossary/#action) and materializing
[artifacts](../../concepts/glossary/#artifact).

This tutorial has 4 parts:

1. Part 0: Hello world
2. Part 1: Query the targets
3. Part 2: Do analysis and extract the information from the analysis result
4. Part 3: Run [action](../../concepts/glossary/#action) and materialize the
   [artifacts](../../concepts/glossary/#artifact)

## Environment

For all following tutorial, we assume you are in [`examples/bxl_tutorial`](
<FbInternalOnly>https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/fbcode/buck2/examples/bxl_tutorial/</FbInternalOnly>
<OssOnly>https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples/bxl_tutorial</OssOnly>
) folder.

This folder contains a buck2 [project](../../concepts/glossary/#project) with
several targets. These targets form this dependency graph:

## Part 0:

In this part, we will use bxl to write a "Hello world" program. We show how to
define a function that receives arguments from the CLI and how to run it.

First, let's create a file named `hello_world.bxl` and open it.

Then, we define a bxl function which can be called by `buck2 bxl`:

```python
main = bxl_main(
    impl = _main,
    cli_args = {},
)
```

`bxl_main` takes 2 arguments:

1. `impl` implementation of this bxl main function
2. `cli_args` we can define the arguments here

Lets run the bxl script to give it a try. The command is in the format
`buck2 bxl [file_path_to_bxl_file]:[bxl_main_function_name]`. For this case it
looks like this:

```
buck2 bxl hello_world.bxl:main
```

As expected, we get this error:

```
Error evaluating module: `root//hello_world.bxl`

Caused by:
    error: Variable `_main` not found, did you mean `main`?
     --> hello_world.bxl:2:12
      |
    2 |     impl = _main,
      |            ^^^^^
      |
```

This is because we haven't defined the implementation function `_main` here.
Let's do that:

```python
def _main(ctx: bxl.Context):
    ctx.output.print("Hello world!")

main = bxl_main(
    impl = _main,
    cli_args = {},
)
```

Now if we run `buck2 bxl hello_world.bxl:main`, we will see the `Hello world!`
in the console.

For this, function `_main` must be defined to accept the argument `ctx` with
type [`bxl.Context`](../../api/bxl/Context/)

We can also use [`cli_args`](../../api/bxl/cli_args/) to pass cli args to bxl.
These args can be accessed in the main function via
[`ctx.cli_args`](../../api/bxl/Context/#contextcli_args).

Here is an example

```python
def _main(ctx: bxl.Context):
    ctx.output.print("Hello " + ctx.cli_args.project_name + "!")

main = bxl_main(
    impl = _main,
    cli_args = {
        "project-name": cli_args.string(),
    },
)
```

We can call bxl like this:

```shell
buck2 bxl hello_world.bxl:main -- --project-name buck2
```

We will see `Hello buck2!` in the console.

## Part 1:

Imagine we're generating index data for a Language Server Protocol (LSP). In our
example, this index data is available in the build graph and originates from the
"index" [sub-target](../../concepts/glossary/#subtarget) of each "library" and
"binary" target. We'll utilize BXL to aggregate all the index data from a given
target's dependencies into a single dataset.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bxl_tutorial/generate_index.png')}
alt='justifyContent'/>

In this part, we will use bxl query and filter to get the targets that we want
to be used for generating index data. Along the way, we will work with target
universes and queries to get exactly the targets we need.

Let's describe the problem we want to solve. We already have (per target graph
above) different types of targets: binaries, libraries, and resources. We only
want the targets that are of type "binary" or "library", since "resource"
targets do not contain index data.

First, create a new file called `generate_index.bxl` with this basic script:

```python
def _main(ctx: bxl.Context):
    ctx.output.print(ctx.cli_args.target)

main = bxl_main(
    impl = _main,
    cli_args = {
        "target": cli_args.target_label(),
    },
)
```

We use this command to run our script:

```shell
buck2 bxl generate_index.bxl:main -- --target //:bin
```

We need to get all the deps of this target, we do that using the
[target universe](../../concepts/glossary/#target-universe) for this target:

```python
universe = ctx.target_universe(ctx.cli_args.target)
```

This will return a [`TargetUniverse`](../../api/bxl/TargetUniverse/) type. Then
we get the all the targets from target universe:

```python
all_targets = universe.universe_target_set()
```

We can print it by `ctx.output.print(pstr(all_targets))`. `pstr` here is used to
prettify the string representation of an object. We can see all the declared
targets, which correspond to the ones displayed in the target graph above:

```
[
  root//:a (<unspecified>),
  root//:b (<unspecified>),
  root//:bin (<unspecified>),
  root//:c (<unspecified>),
  root//:d (<unspecified>),
  root//:data_a (<unspecified>),
  root//:e (<unspecified>)
]
```

Finally, we need to do a filter, we can use
[`ctx.cquery().kind`](../../api/bxl/CqueryContext/#cquerycontextkind) to filter
the targets to only get the targets which is binary or library

```python
nodes = ctx.cquery().kind("^(binary|library)$", all_targets)
ctx.output.print(pstr(nodes))
```

We run the bxl script and the output shows our filtered targets:

```
[
  root//:a (<unspecified>),
  root//:b (<unspecified>),
  root//:bin (<unspecified>),
  root//:c (<unspecified>),
  root//:d (<unspecified>),
  root//:e (<unspecified>)
]
```

Note that `root//:data_a` is no longer in the list, since it's a resource
target.

You can find the complete code for this tutorial in [`part1.bxl`](
<FbInternalOnly>https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/fbcode/buck2/examples/bxl_tutorial/part1.bxl</FbInternalOnly>
<OssOnly>https://github.com/facebook/buck2/blob/main/examples/bxl_tutorial/part1.bxl</OssOnly>
).

## Part 2

In this part, we'll extend our script to analyze the targets we filtered and
extract their index information. We'll see how to work with analysis results and
access sub-targets.

Let's continue with the script we made in Part 1. Let's get the
[analysis](../../api/bxl/Context/#contextanalysis) for these nodes:

```python
analysis_res_dict = ctx.analysis(nodes)
```

This gives us a dictionary, where keys are target
[labels](../../api/build/Label/#label) and values are of type
[AnalysisResult](../../api/bxl/AnalysisResult/)

Index data is in each target's "index"
[sub-target](../../concepts/glossary/#subtarget)'s `default_outputs`, so iterate
through `analysis_res_dict` to get that:

```python
index_outputs = []
for _, analysis_res in analysis_res_dict.items():
    default_info = analysis_res.as_dependency()[DefaultInfo]
    index_sub_target_provider = default_info.sub_targets["index"]
    index_outputs.extend(index_sub_target_provider[DefaultInfo].default_outputs)
```

Let's see what's happening in each step:

1. We create an empty list to store our index outputs
2. We loop through each analysis result
3. We get the DefaultInfo [provider](../../concepts/glossary/#provider) from
   each result
4. We access the "index" [sub-target](../../concepts/glossary/#subtarget)
5. Finally, we collect the default outputs from each index sub-target

Feel free to print each step's result to follow what the script is doing.

Finally, we print the results:

```python
ctx.output.print(index_outputs)
```

You'll see output like this:

```
[
  <build artifact a.index bound to root//:a (<unspecified>)>,
  <build artifact b.index bound to root//:b (<unspecified>)>,
  <build artifact bin.index bound to root//:bin (<unspecified>)>,
  <build artifact c.index bound to root//:c (<unspecified>)>,
  <build artifact d.index bound to root//:d (<unspecified>)>,
  <build artifact e.index bound to root//:e (<unspecified>)>
]
```

You can find the complete code for this tutorial in [`part2.bxl`](
<FbInternalOnly>https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/fbcode/buck2/examples/bxl_tutorial/part2.bxl</FbInternalOnly>
<OssOnly>https://github.com/facebook/buck2/blob/main/examples/bxl_tutorial/part2.bxl</OssOnly>
).

## Part 3

In this part, we show how to run an [action](../../concepts/glossary/#action) to
write all the collected index paths to a file and materialize this index data.
We show how to run actions and do materialization.

We'll build upon what we created in Part 2.

First, let's modify our script to write all the index paths to a file:

```python
actions = ctx.bxl_actions().actions
index_db = actions.write("index.txt", index_outputs)
```

It creates the [action object](../../api/build/AnalysisActions/) and then writes
all the index path to the file named `index.txt`.

With such, bxl will not run the action to get the output, it just declares the
action. We need to call
[`ctx.output.ensure`](../../api/bxl/OutputStream/#outputstreamensure) to make
our outputs available.

```python
ensured_index_db = ctx.output.ensure(index_db)
ctx.output.print(ensured_index_db)
```

Running the script will show us where our file was created:

```
buck-out/v2/gen-bxl/root/78ceb8c295d0ab4e/part3.bxl/__main__e0c0381aecee358a__/index.txt
```

We open this file and to see all the index paths:

```
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__a__/a.index
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__b__/b.index
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__bin__/bin.index
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__c__/c.index
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__d__/d.index
buck-out/v2/gen/root/6dd044292ff31ae1/__e__/e.index
```

It shows all the index path, but if we check the content of the index, it will
not error that "no such file or directory". This is because we don't ensure the
these artifacts.

So we ensure our index files to make them available:

```python
ctx.output.ensure_multiple(index_outputs)
```

Now we can confirm these index files are available on our disk.

).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we built a complete BXL script that:

1. Gets a target universe and filters for specific target types
2. Extracts index information from build targets
3. Writes the collected paths to a file and materializes the index files

Here's what we learned along the way:

1. How to use target universes to get dependencies
2. Filtering targets with cquery
3. Analyzing targets and accessing their properties
4. Running actions to write files
5. Ensuring outputs are available on disk

The final script demonstrates a common BXL workflow: starting from a target,
finding related targets, extracting information, and producing outputs. This
pattern can be used as a foundation for building more complex BXL scripts.
