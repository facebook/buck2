//! Cycle detection in DICE

/// Whether DICE looks for dependency cycles among running computations.
///
/// A computation that depends, through others, on itself never finishes, and neither does
/// anything that depends on it. With detection enabled, DICE periodically checks whether a
/// version's computations are stuck on each other and, when they are, fails the requests that
/// make up the cycle with a `DiceError`, which the computations involved then see from
/// `DiceComputations::compute`. Detection is periodic, and deferred while other computations are
/// still completing, so a cycle is reported within about two check intervals of the computation
/// as a whole coming to a halt rather than immediately; see `DiceDataBuilder` for the interval.
///
/// A computation that races a dependency against something DICE knows nothing about looks stuck
/// on that dependency all the same, so such a computation can be failed for a cycle it would
/// have gotten out of by itself.
///
/// The detector is a task spawned through the `Spawner` of the transaction that starts a
/// version's first computation, and it sleeps on tokio timers, so the runtime it ends up on
/// must have those enabled.
