    There are two modes: "allowlist" mode, "blocklist" mode

    "allowlist" mode:

        Only deps matching patterns in "allowlist_patterns' will pass the check.
        If at least one target in a transitive closure of all dependencies doesn't
        match anything in "allowlist_patterns" the test will fail.

        In this mode "blocklist_patterns" is used to allow for additional restriction
        to be applied. If a specific target from transitive closure of all dependencies
        matches at least one pattern from "blocklist_patterns", the test will fail
        regardless if that target matches anything in "allowlist_patterns".

        In other words, for test to pass each target must match at least one
        pattern from "allowlist_patterns", and must not match anything from the
        "blocklist_patterns".


    "blocklist" mode"

        If at least one target from a transitive closure of dependnecies matches
        at least one pattern from "blocklist_patterns" the test will fail.


        In this mode "allowlist_patterns" modifies how "blocklist_patterns" are
        applied. Specifically if a specific target matches "allowlist_patterns"
        then it will always pass, and will not be checked against "blocklist_patterns".

        The use case is to allow blocking more generic location (for example,
        blocklist; //testing/.*), while still allowing specific exceptions
        (for example, allowlist: //testing/jest/.*).
