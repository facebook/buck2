//! Constraints are the building block of buck platforms.
//!
//! A constraint is identified by a "constraint key" defined by a `constraint_setting()`
//! target. There may be multiple possible values for the constraint, each defined by a
//! `constraint_value()` target.
//!
//! Currently, a platform or configuration has at most a single value for each constraint.
