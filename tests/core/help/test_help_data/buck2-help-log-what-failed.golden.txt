# This file is @generated, regenerate by re-running test with `-- --env BUCK2_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` appended to the test command

Outputs every command that failed in the selected invocation.

Look at the help for what-ran to understand the output format.

Usage: buck2 log what-failed [OPTIONS] [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]
          A path to an event-log file to read from

Options:
      --recent <NUMBER>
          Open the event-log file from a recent command

      --trace-id <ID>
          Show log by trace id

      --allow-remote
          This option does nothing

      --no-remote
          Do not allow downloading the log from manifold if it's not found locally

      --format <FORMAT>
          Which output format to use for this command

          Possible values:
          - readable:  Human-readable output (default)
          - tabulated: Tab-delimited output. Deprecated in favor of `readable`
          - json:      JSON format, one object per line
          - csv:       Comma-separated values (CSV) format

          [default: readable]

      --emit-cache-queries


      --skip-cache-hits


      --skip-remote-executions


      --skip-local-executions


      --filter-category <FILTER_CATEGORY>
          Regular expression to filter commands by given action category (i.e. type of of actions
          that are similar but operate on different inputs, such as invocations of a C++ compiler
          (whose category would be `cxx_compile`)). Matches by full string

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [env: BUCK_VERBOSE=]
          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
