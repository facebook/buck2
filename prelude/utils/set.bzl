# A set is useful when the `dedupe` builtin is not applicable. Dedupe looks at
# identity of the value (some kind of pointer) rather than equality, so for
# example doesn't eliminate duplicates of the same string value obtained from
# different places:
#
#     things = ["huh", "huh"]
#     expect(len(dedupe(things)) == 2)
#
#     huh = "huh"
#     things = [huh, huh]
#     expect(len(dedupe(things)) == 1)
#
# In contrast a set compares its entries for equality, not identity, and will
# never contain one entry equal to another entry.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     things = set()
#     for x in somewhere:
#         things.add(x)
#     return things.list()

# Name the record `set_record` to enable users to use `set` to initialize a set.
set_record = record(
    _entries = field(dict),
    list = field(typing.Callable),
    # Adds the value to the set, returning whether the value existed in the set
    add = field(typing.Callable),
    # Removes the value if the value is in the set, returning whether the value existed in the set
    remove = field(typing.Callable),
    # Adds the values to the set, returning the values that were added
    update = field(typing.Callable),
    # Returns whether the value is in the set
    contains = field(typing.Callable),
    size = field(typing.Callable),
)

# For typing a set, you may use `set_type` or `set_record.type`, the former is
# encouraged to avoid leaking the underlying implementation.
