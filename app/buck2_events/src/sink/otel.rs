//! An event sink that exports the end-of-invocation [`InvocationRecord`](buck2_data::InvocationRecord)
//! to OpenTelemetry (OTLP) as a single "wide event" span.
//!
//! This is a peer of the Scribe [`RemoteEventSink`](crate::sink::remote::RemoteEventSink): it has
//! the same shape (`send_now` / `send_messages_now` / `offer` / [`EventSink`]) so callers route the
//! record to it exactly as they route to Scribe, with no special-casing. Unlike Scribe it is not
//! Meta-specific, so it is the wide-event export path in open-source builds too.
//!
//! The actual proto -> attribute mapping lives in `crate::sink::otel_record`; spans are emitted
//! through [`buck2_core::logging::otel`], which owns the exporter lifecycle (activation after the
//! daemon fork, flushing on exit).
