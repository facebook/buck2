# NOTE: At the moment, target platforms and constraint values can't be propagated via build rule
#       attributes all the way to configuration transitions. The reason is that the transition
#       function is invoked before the rule, so any PlatformInfo and ConstraintValueInfo providers
#       present in the rule attributes aren't resolved at this time.
#
#       Because of this, the list of possible target platforms and constraint values is encoded
#       here in the form of config settings with lists of comma-separated elements. Specifically,
#       the configuration transition relies on the following config settings:
#
#           * buck2.platforms
#           * buck2.constraints
#           * buck2.passthrough_constraints
#
#       buck2.platforms and buck2.constraints list all possible target platforms and constraint
#       values, and buck2.passthrough_constraints lists constraint settings to preserve when
#       applying the configuration transition. The use of read_config avoids hard-coding these
#       repo-specific configuration rules into the prelude.
