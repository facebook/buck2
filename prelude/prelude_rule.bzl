load("@prelude//:is_full_meta_repo.bzl", "is_full_meta_repo")

# The declaration of a rule that the prelude exposes via `native` and documents.
#
# Conventions:
#  - A rule is declared in the `.bzl` file that implements it, next to its
#    implementation function.
#  - Attribute groups shared between the rules of one language live in that
#    language's `attrs.bzl`; groups shared across languages live in `decls/`.
#    Keep `attrs.bzl` files free of implementation code so that implementation
#    files can load them without cycles.
#  - Every language directory has a `rules.bzl` that turns its declarations
#    into `rule` objects with `make_rules` and exports both: the declarations
#    as `specs` and the rule objects as `rules`. `prelude//:rules.bzl` only
#    collects those. The rule objects are created in the per-language files on
#    purpose: a target's rule type is attributed to the file that creates the
#    `rule`, so this keeps the set of files whose changes make CI rebuild a
#    target down to that target's own language.
