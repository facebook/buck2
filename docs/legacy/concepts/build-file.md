# Build File

A *build file* is a file, typically named `BUCK`, that defines one or more [build rule](https://buck.build/concept/build_rule.html)s.
Note that you can change the name that Buck uses for the build file in the `buildfile` section of [`.buckconfig`](https://buck.build/files-and-dirs/buckconfig.html).
A source file in your project can only be referenced by rules in its "nearest" build file, where "nearest" means its closest direct ancestor in your project's file tree. (If a source file has a build file as a sibling, then that is its nearest ancestor.) For example, if your project had the following `BUCK` files:

```
java/com/facebook/base/BUCK
java/com/facebook/common/BUCK
java/com/facebook/common/collect/BUCK
```

Then your build rules would have the following constraints:

* Rules in `java/com/facebook/base/BUCK` can reference any file under `java/com/facebook/base/`.
* Rules in `java/com/facebook/common/` can reference any files under that directory, except for those under `java/com/facebook/common/collect/`, as those "belong" to the `BUCK` file in the `collect` directory.

The set of source files accessible to a build file is also known as its *build package*.
The way to refer to code across build packages is to create build rules and use `deps` to refer to that code. Going back to the previous example, suppose code in `java/com/facebook/common/concurrent/` wants to depend on code in `java/com/facebook/common/collect/`. Presumably `java/com/facebook/common/collect/BUCK` has a build rule like:

```
java_library(
  name = 'collect',
  srcs = glob(['*.java']),
  deps = ['//java/com/facebook/base:base',],)
```

Then `java/com/facebook/common/BUCK` could have a rule like:

```
java_library(
  name = 'concurrent',
  srcs = glob(['concurrent/*.java']),
  deps = ['//java/com/facebook/base:base','//java/com/facebook/common/collect:collect',],)
```

whereas the following **would be invalid** because `java/com/facebook/common/collect/` has its own build file, so `//java/com/facebook/common/collect:concurrent` cannot list `java/com/facebook/common/collect/*.java` in its `srcs`.

```
java_library(
  name = 'concurrent',
  srcs = glob(['collect/*.java', 'concurrent/*.java']),
  deps = ['//java/com/facebook/base:base',],)
```
