## Symlinks

In Windows, there are two types of symlinks: file and directory.

You can find out which type of symlink is being created using:
`dir /AL /S <path>`.

The command lists all of the symbolic links in the `<path>` directory:

- `^<SYMLINKD^>` is a Directory SymLink
- `^<SYMLINK^>` is a File SymLink

## Target names

Escaping the '=' symbol on Windows is quite complicated: make sure none of the
targets being built contain this symbol as it could cause build breakages.
