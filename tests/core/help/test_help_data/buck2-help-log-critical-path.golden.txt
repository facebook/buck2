# This file is @generated, regenerate by re-running test with `-- --env BUCK2_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` appended to the test command

Show the critical path for a selected build.

This produces output listing every node on the critical path.

It includes the kind of node, its name, category and identifier, as well as total duration (runtime
of this node), user duration (duration the user can improve), potential improvement before this node
stops being on the critical path, non-critical path time, and start offset.

The `readable` format produces space-aligned columnar output with a header: `<start_offset> <total>
<waiting> <user> <potential> <kind> <name> <category> <identifier> <execution_kind>`

The `tabulated` format produces tab-delimited output:
`<kind>\t<name>\t<category>\t<identifier>\t<execution_kind>\t<total_duration>\t<user_duration>\t<potential_improvement_duration>\t<non_critical_path_time>\t<start_offset>`

All durations are in microseconds. Start offset is in microseconds from the beginning of the build.

Usage: buck2 log critical-path [OPTIONS] [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]
          A path to an event-log file to read from

Options:
      --recent <NUMBER>
          Open the event-log file from a recent command

      --trace-id <ID>
          Show log by trace id

      --allow-remote
          This option does nothing

      --no-remote
          Do not allow downloading the log from manifold if it's not found locally

      --format <FORMAT>
          Which output format to use for this command

          Possible values:
          - readable:  Human-readable output (default)
          - tabulated: Tab-delimited output. Deprecated in favor of `readable`
          - json:      JSON format, one object per line
          - csv:       Comma-separated values (CSV) format

          [default: readable]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
