//! The core state of an incremental computation engine: sound reuse of computed values across
//! versions, branches of versions, and concurrent access to any of them.
//!
//! This crate is the data structure specified in `dice/docs/incrementality.md`; section
//! references throughout the code point there. It knows nothing about values, execution or
//! scheduling: keys and revisions are opaque identities, and an execution environment (dice, or
//! anything else) computes values, mints revisions for them, and reports what it computed as
//! [`Cert`]ificates. In return, [`CoreState::lookup`] tells the environment which revision a key
//! has at a version, or that it does not know.
//!
//! The environment plugs in through the [`Env`] trait, which names the data it wants the core to
//! carry: the dependency payload of a certificate, data per claim, and data per assertion.
//! The core never interprets any of them.
