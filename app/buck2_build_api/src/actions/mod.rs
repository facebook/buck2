//! This module contains support for running actions and asynchronous providers
//!
//! An 'Action' is a unit of work with a set of input files known as 'Artifact's that are required
//! for its execution, and a set of output files called 'BuildArtifact's that are created by its
//! execution. Each 'Action' registered by a rule will only be executed when it's 'BuildArtifact's
//! are requested to be available. It will be guaranteed by the action system that all input
//! 'Artifact's are available before the execution of an 'Action'.
//!
//! 'Actions' struct will act as a general registry where users can create new 'Artifact's that
//! represent the outputs of the execution of their 'Action'. These are 'DeclaredArtifact's that
//! are yet bound to any 'Action's. When 'Action's are registered, they will be bound to their
//! appropriate 'DeclaredArtifact' to create a 'BuildArtifact'
//!
//! An 'Action' can be bound to multiple 'BuildArtifact's, but each 'BuildArtifact' can only be
//! bound to a particular 'Action'.
