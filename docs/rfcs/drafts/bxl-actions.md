# Bxl Actions and Build API

Bxl allows integrators to write Starlark snippets that introspect the buck2 graph,
and perform various operations on them within Starlark to accomplish complex
operations, as previously proposed in [bxl RFC](../bxl.md))


This document is intended at discussing the aspects of build and actions declaration
of a bxl function in more details, and proposed changes to deferred framework to
support bxl actions.

## Actions API

The actions API should be the same as rules' actions API. That is, it has the same
`ctx.actions` that allows registering of artifacts, creating actions, dynamic
actions via the same api.

## Creating and Building the Actions

Bxl allows users to build targets and actions. However, when creating actions, they
are not bound/buildable until the artifact/action factories are finalized.
As such, we will introduce the limitation that bxl cannot build artifacts that they
themselves declared within the bxl. Instead, they will return a set of artifacts
to expose to users, which buck2 will automatically build after finalizing the
action factory.
For dynamic-ness, bxl users will use the standard dynamic output api.
There is an issue that during the dynamic output api's lambda, bxl functions will not
be able to access the regular bxl functions for queries, etc. However, this is likely
not important as most use cases should reasonably query bxl data before the dynamic
outputs, and have limited power in dynamic-ness. We can also always replace the
ctx of the dynamic to be the bxl context in the future, as we see fit.

Sample:
```python
def my_bxl(ctx):
    actions_factory = ctx.bxl_actions.factory()

    artifact = actions_factory.write("file.txt", "content")

    # note that existing artifacts that were declared by other rules can be built
    ctx.actions.build(ctx.analysis(ctx.target("foo")).providers[DefaultInfo].default_output))

    return [artifact] # exposes the declared artifact to users
```


## Internal Representation (Deferred Framework)

The existing actions framework attaches all actions to a deferred, which is based
off a `ConfiguredLabel`, which also corresponds to the output path prefix.
bxl actions should also have a unique output path prefix, and follow the same system
of having a base deferred key to reuse the action implementation.

We should extend the `BaseKey` of a `DeferredKey` to support beyond a `ConfiguredLabel`,
so that we can use a `BxlFunctionLabel` in its place.
This would allow `owner` of these actions to point to the correct creator. The output
path would be determined by using the `BxlFunctionLabel` as prefix similar to a label.
While this means that not all outputs are associated with an actual rule, this is
arguably more correct as bxl that creates outputs that doesn't fit the target graph
structure (i.e android project generation follows directory structure rather than the
packages  defined by targets) to not have to conform the attaching their actions to
existing rules. bxl functions can examine multiple rules and create a single action,
attached only to their function label.

The ActionRegistry will be attached to the evaluation result of `bxl`. Since we do not
allow bxl to explicitly request build of the actions itself declares, we can wait until
the end of the bxl function to finalize the actions. Then, the action lookup can simply
refer to the result of the `bxl`.

With the above changes, the rest of the actions framework does not need changed to support
the proposed API.
DICE caching will work as today.
