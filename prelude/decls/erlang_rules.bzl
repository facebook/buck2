        The `erlang_release` target does by default (without overlays) package:

        The `erlang_test` ruls defines a test target for a single test suite. In most cases you
        want to define multiple suites in one go. The `erlang_tests` macro allows users to generate
        `erlang_test` targets for multiple test suites. Each suite `<name>_SUITE.erl` will have a
        generated hidden `erlang_test` target whose name is `<name>_SUITE`.

        Each `erlang_test` target implements tests using the Common Test library
        [OTP documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/common_test.html). They can,
        although **it is not recommended**, also act as dependencies of other tests. The
        default output of this rule is a "test_folder", consisting of the compiled test suite
        and the data directory.


        For each suite  `<name>_SUITE.erl`, if a data_dir `<name>_SUITE_data` is present along the suite,
        (as per [the data_dir naming scheme for ct](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/common_test/write_test_chapter.html#data-and-private-directories)),
        it will automatically adds the coresponding resource target to the generated test target of the suite.
        Resources will be placed in the [Data directory (data_dir)](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/common_test/write_test_chapter.html#data_priv_dir)
        of each of the suite.

        It allows the writer of the rule to add global configuration files and global default
        dependencies (e.g `meck`). These ones should be specified using global
        variables `erlang.erlang_tests_default_apps` and `erlang.erlang_tests_default_config`
        respectively.

        The `erlang_tests` macro forwards all attributes to the `erlang_test`. It defines some attributes
        that control how the targets get generated:
        - `srcs` ([source]): Set of files that the suites might depend on and that are not part of any specific application.
          A "meta" application having those files as sources will automatically be created, and included in the dependencies
          of the tests.

        One can call
        - `buck2 build //my_app:test_SUITE` to compile the test files together with its depedencies.
        - `buck2 test //my_app:other_test_SUITE` to run the test.
        - `buck2 run //my_app:other_test_SUITE` to open an interactive test shell, where tests can be run iteratively.


        buck2 test will rely on tpx to run the suite. To get access to tpx commands, add `--` after the
        target. For example:

        - `buck2 test //my_app:other_test_SUITE -- --help` will print the list of tpx available
        command line parameters.
        - `buck2 test //my_app:other_test_SUITE -- group.mycase` will only run those test cases
        that match the pattern `group.mycase`
