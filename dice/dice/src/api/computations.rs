    ///
    /// ## Why
    ///
    /// Dice records the dependencies of a key in structured form. Concretely, that means that if
    /// you have two dependencies, `K1` and `K2`, we track whether you depended on them
    /// sequentially:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let r1 = ctx.compute(&K1).await;
    /// let r2 = ctx.compute(&K2).await;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Or in parallel:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let (r1, r2) = ctx.compute2(&K1, &K2).await; // Also `compute_many`, `compute_join`, etc.
    /// ```
    ///
    /// To understand why, consider that the sequential case might instead look like this:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let r = ctx.compute(&K1).await;
    /// if r == 42 {
    ///     r1 += ctx.compute(&K2).await;
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// When recomputing your deps to check if they changed, we will reproduce the
    /// parallel/sequential structure. That's important because - in the example above - if the
    /// value of `K1` did indeed change away from 42, initiating evaluation of `K2` may be
    /// inappropriate. At the very least it's wasted work, but it can violate preconditions for
    /// evaluating K2 (though we discourage such preconditions anyway, but they're not always easy
    /// to avoid).
    ///
    /// So: This API. You can still ask for things to be done in parallel, but must do so in a way
    /// that dice can understand.
    ///
    /// If you do not want to put up with this, you have an escape hatch in the form of
    /// `DiceComputations::with_linear_recompute`. `with_linear_recompute` gives you free access to
    /// unstructured dependencies, in exchange for pessimizing the recompute path by doing it in
