    # FIXME(JakobDegen): The rules themselves do not need any of the exec configured providers.
    # They only ever access the `RustProcMacroMarker` provider and do everything else through
    # plugins. However, we cannot return just that provider, since it results in
    # `buck2 build :proc_macro` building nothing. We would get the right behavior out of the
    # command line build invocation by taking a regular target dep on the aliased target and
    # returning those targets. However, that also does not work because it would result the target
    # configuration for a Rust library needing to be compatible with the target configuration for
    # its proc macro deps (a Linux-only proc macro should still be usable in a Rust build targeting
    # Mac).
    #
    # Instead, we take an exec dep on the aliased target and return those providers. This is a
    # compromise solution. The upside is that it avoids introducing any unnecessary compatibility
    # constraints. The downside is that it's still slightly wrong - because of the exec transition,
    # the returned artifacts won't correctly obey opt level/sanitizer/platform constraints in the
    # target configuration. However, this matches the behavior in fbsource today.
    #
    # Once config modifiers are implemented and roll out, it should not be too hard to get the fully
    # correct behavior
