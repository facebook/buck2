## Installing Buck2

To get started, first install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), then compile the `buck2` executable:

```bash
rustup install nightly-2023-01-24
cargo +nightly-2023-01-24 install --git https://github.com/facebook/buck2.git buck2
```

The above commands install `buck2` into a suitable directory, such as `$HOME/.cargo/bin`, which you should then add to your `$PATH`:

```sh
export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH
```

With Buck2 installed, you can build projects with `buck2`!

## Compiling your first project

This section covers the building of a ['hello_world' example project](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples/hello_world) that contains a simple C++ binary. If you are interested in seeing how other languages can be built, take a look at the [prelude example project](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples/prelude), which contains Rust, C++, Python, and OCaml targets.

First, clone the buck2 repository and cd into the 'hello_world' project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/buck2.git
cd buck2/examples/hello_world
```

 `buck2 init --git` is all the setup you need to start building. This will use git submodule to pull [buck2-prelude](https://github.com/facebook/buck2-prelude) into your project:

```sh
buck2 init --git
```

To use another version control system, run `buck2 init` and manually download [buck2-prelude](https://github.com/facebookincubator/buck2-prelude) into `prelude` at root.
```sh
buck2 init
```

To build the entire project, run:

Note: _Requires clang to be in the path_
```sh
buck2 build //...
```

Note that this uses a [simple C++ toolchain](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/blob/main/prelude/toolchains/cxx.bzl) that requires a recent version of `clang` to be installed on your system. This can be installed with any package manager (ex. `apt install clang`, `xcode-select --install` on macOS, `choco install llvm`).
After installing any external tools or changing your `PATH`, run `buck2 kill` before running a build.


To list all targets available in the project, run:

```sh
buck2 targets //...
```

To run the main C++ binary, run:

```sh
buck2 run //:main
```

The newly built binary can be found with the `--show-output` flag:

```sh
buck2 build //:main --show-output
```

Output:

```sh
Build ID: 0e890477-5b7f-4829-9ffe-662e572320a0
Jobs completed: 3. Time elapsed: 0.0s.

```

## Creating your first hello_world project

This section demonstrates how to create a simple C++ 'hello_world' project.

To get started, make a new folder for your project and cd into it.

```sh
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
```

Next, run `buck2 init --git` to initialize the project. This command will set up your project with `git` and pull in [buck2-prelude](https://github.com/facebook/buck2-prelude) as a submodule. Additionally, it will generate multiple files with default values.

```sh
buck2 init --git
```

Next, add the source code `main.cpp` ,

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello from a C++ Buck2 program!" << std::endl;
}
```

Then, define a `cxx_binary` in the root `BUCK` file:

```Python
# BUCK
cxx_binary(
    name = "main",
    srcs = ["main.cpp"],
    link_style = "static",
)
```

If you try to build `//:main` at this point, you'll see an error about `buck2` not being able to find `toolchains//:cxx`.

The final step is to define the necessary toolchain targets. For that project, you need `system_cxx_toolchain` and `system_python_bootstrap_toolchain`, which will pick up the necessary tools (clang++, python, and so on) from the system.

```Python
# toolchains/BUCK
load("@prelude//toolchains:cxx.bzl", "system_cxx_toolchain")
load("@prelude//toolchains:python.bzl", "system_python_bootstrap_toolchain")

system_cxx_toolchain(
    name = "cxx",
    visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
)

system_python_bootstrap_toolchain(
    name = "python_bootstrap",
    visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
)
```

At this point, your project should have the following files:

```bash
$ tree -a -I "buck-out|prelude|.git"
|-- .buckconfig
|-- .gitmodules
|-- BUCK
|-- main.cpp
`-- toolchains
    `-- BUCK
```

Now, you're ready to see the build in action.

To build the main C++ target, run:

```sh
buck2 build //:main
```

To run the main C++ target, run:

```sh
buck2 run //:main
```

In summary, a `buck2` project requires:
1. A `.buckconfig` file in the root which has a `[repositories]` section listing out [cells](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/glossary/#cell)
2. A `prelude` directory, which contains a collection of [rules](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/glossary/#rule) of your choice. `buck2 init` will pull in the [buck2-prelude](https://github.com/facebook/buck2-prelude.git) as a git submodule by default
3. If using the [buck2-prelude](https://github.com/facebook/buck2-prelude.git), a `toolchains` directory that declares relevant toolchains. We provide some basic toolchains in [prelude/toolchains](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/prelude/toolchains)
4. `BUCK` files that specify targets for your project

`buck2 init --git` will generate all of these with reasonable default values.

## Learning More

You should now be ready to explore Buck2 for use in your own projects. You can explore the [examples](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples) folder.  Look out for more tutorials in the future.
