//! One pass over a buck2 event-log stream, keeping exactly what the
//! trace/graph emitters need.  This is the native-decode port of the
//! Python converter's `parse_log` (make-rust `trace-buck.py`); the
//! behavioral spec it preserves is archived at
//! `trace-runs/ingest-2026-09-05/recon/spec-converter.md`.
//!
//! Version contract: the action-graph encoding is declared twice —
//! `ActionGraphStart.schema` as soon as the build command starts
//! and `ActionGraphFooter.schema` in the end-of-build footer, so
//! even a log truncated short of the footer names its encoding.  This
//! reader speaks schema 1: integer-id tset projections, and reused
//! structure recorded only where an action that ran lies below it. The
//! rest of the reused graph is named without its inputs, which makes the
//! capture scoped to what the actions that ran depend on. It refuses any
//! other declared schema by name — never a shape heuristic — and checks
//! that start and footer declarations agree.  A log with neither
//! declaration was written without dep capture; absence downgrades
//! completeness (dangling refs stop being proof of corruption) but is not
//! a refusal.
