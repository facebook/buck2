//! Trait for Starlark values that can be deserialized from pagable format.

/// Trait for Starlark values that can be deserialized at the brand `'fv`.
///
/// This trait is used during arena deserialization to reconstruct each value
/// in the heap. The deserialization is done via the vtable, allowing for
/// dynamic dispatch during heap reconstruction.
///
/// `'fv` is the brand of the heap the value is being deserialized into (see the `branding`
/// module), and the [`Value`]s the context hands out are `Value<'fv>`. A type that holds starlark
/// values therefore implements the trait at its own brand, `impl<'v> StarlarkDeserialize<'v> for
/// Foo<'v>`, and a type that holds none implements it at every brand, `impl<'fv>
/// StarlarkDeserialize<'fv> for Bar`; `#[derive(StarlarkPagable)]` picks the shape from the type's
/// lifetime parameters.

/// returned. Used by `#[derive(StarlarkPagable)]` to give blameable error
/// messages — `"deserializing field foo"` is much more useful than the raw

/// Context for deserialization - wraps PagableDeserializer.
///
/// This trait provides the interface that StarlarkDeserialize implementations
/// use to deserialize their data. It abstracts over the underlying deserialization
/// mechanism.
///
/// `'de` is the lifetime of the pagable deserializer's input. `'fv` is the brand of the heap
/// whose value is being deserialized: every value the context hands out lives in that heap or
/// in a heap it references, and the brand is introduced by the framework for one value's
/// deserialization only, the way [`Heap::temp`](crate::values::Heap::temp) introduces a brand, so
/// a [`StarlarkDeserialize`] implementation cannot put a value anywhere the brand does not reach.

/// That is, `Self` with `'fv` in place of `'v` (its [`Reinfect`](IsStaticType::Reinfect))
/// implements [`StarlarkDeserialize<'fv>`]. Implemented for every type whose static-type impls
/// say so; it exists so that the heap deserializer, which names a value type through the vtable
/// of one instantiation, can ask for the type at the brand it is deserializing at.
