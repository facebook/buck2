//! Lookup maps for registered static heaps.
//!
//! Heaps registered through [`StaticHeapEntry`] (`globals_static!` /
//! `methods_static!`) are process-wide singletons: they are always resident,
//! and every value allocated in them serializes as a `StaticValueId`.
//! Serialized data therefore references these heaps by [`StaticHeapId`] and
//! resolves back to the live heap, instead of paging their bodies through
//! storage.

/// assumption `StaticValueId` already makes). Heap names cannot serve as the
/// identifier: distinct static heaps can share a name (`<module_path>::<NAME>`),
/// e.g. two `globals_static!` in different `fn` bodies of one module.
