//! Types representing Starlark modules ([`Module`] and [`FrozenModule`]) and global variables ([`Globals`]).

//! Global functions and values are stored in [`Globals`], which are typically

//! User executions store their values in a [`Module`], which have to be converted to a
//! [`FrozenModule`] using [`freeze`](Module::freeze) before they can be `load()`'d as a dependency.
