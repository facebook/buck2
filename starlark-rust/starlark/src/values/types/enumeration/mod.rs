//! Fixed set enumerations, with runtime checking of validity.
//!
//! Calling `enum()` produces an [`EnumType`]. Calling the [`EnumType`] creates an [`EnumValue`].
//!
//! The implementation ensures that each value of the enumeration is only stored once,
//! so they may also provide (modest) memory savings. Created in starlark with the
//! `enum` function:
//!
//! ```
//! # starlark::assert::pass(r#"
//! Colors = enum("Red", "Green", "Blue")
//! val = Colors("Red")
//! assert_eq(val.value, "Red")
//! assert_eq(val.index, 0)
//! assert_eq(Colors[0], val)
//! assert_eq(Colors.type, "Colors")
//! assert_eq([v.value for v in Colors], ["Red", "Green", "Blue"])
//! # "#);
//! ```
