 * -sites, even across JARs. To make this work, we need to retain more in the ABIs of Kotlin JARs:
 *
 * <p>- The body (bytecode) of inline functions which is what `kotlinc` bases the code it inlines
 * on. - Nested classes defined within inline functions. Rather than referring to those classes in
 * the defining JAR, they are duplicated in the calling JAR, and so their implementation details
 * cannot be stripped either.
 *
 * <p>This class keeps track of Kotlin class' inline functions, and classes that are nested inside
 * inline functions (or nested inside classes that are nested inside inline functions, and so on,
 * transitively).
