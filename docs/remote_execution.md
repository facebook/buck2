title: Remote Execution
---

Buck2 can use services that expose [Bazel's remote execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis) in order to run actions remotely.

Buck2 projects have been successfully tested for remote execution against [EngFlow](https://www.engflow.com/) and [BuildBarn](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution). Sample project configurations for those providers are available under [examples/remote_execution](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples/remote_execution).

## RE configuration in `.buckconfig`

Configuration for remote execution can be found under `[buck2_re_client]` in `.buckconfig`.

Keys supported include:

* `engine_address` - address to your RE's engine.
* `action_cache_address` - address to your action cache endpoint.
* `cas_address` - address to your content-addressable storage (CAS) endpoint.
* `tls_ca_certs` - path to a CA certificates bundle. This must be PEM-encoded. If none is set, a default bundle will be used. This path contain environment variables using shell interpolation syntax (i.e. $VAR). They will be substituted before reading the file.
* `tls_client_cert` - path to a client certificate (and intermediate chain), as well as its associated private key. This must be PEM-encoded. This path can contain environment variables using shell interpolation syntax (i.e. $VAR). They will be substituted before reading the file.
* `http_headers` - HTTP headers to inject in all requests to RE. This is a comma-separated list of `Header: Value` pairs. Minimal validation of those headers is done here. This can contain environment variables using shell interpolation syntax ($VAR). They will be substituted before reading the file.

Buck2 uses `SHA256` for all its hashing by default. If your RE engine requires something else, this can be configured in `.buckconfig` as follows:

```ini
[buck2]
# Accepts BLAKE3, SHA1, or SHA256
digest_algorithms = BLAKE3
```

## RE platform configuration

Next, your build will need an [execution platform](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/glossary/#execution-platform) that specifies how and where actions should be executed. For a sample platform definition that sets up an execution platform to utilize RE, take a look at the [EngFlow example](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/blob/main/examples/remote_execution/engflow/platforms/defs.bzl).

To enable remote execution, configure the following fields in [CommandExecutorConfig](https://buck2.build/docs/api/build/build/#commandexecutorconfig) as follows:

* `remote_enabled` - set to `True`.
* `local_enabled` - set to `True` if you also want to run actions locally.
* `use_limited_hybrid` - set to `False` unless you want to exclusively run remotely when possible.
* `remote_execution_properties` - other additional properties.
  * If the RE engine requires a container image, this can be done by setting `container-image` to an image URL, as is done in the example above.
