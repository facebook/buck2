    """Create a directory with most of the same contents as manifest_dir, but
    excluding Rustup's rust-toolchain.toml configuration file.

    Keeping rust-toolchain.toml goes wrong in the situation that all of the
    following happen:

      1. toolchains//:rust uses compiler = "rustc", like the
         system_rust_toolchain.

      2. The rustc in $PATH is rustup's rustc shim.

      3. A third-party dependency has both a rust-toolchain.toml and a build.rs
         that runs "rustc" or env::var_os("RUSTC"), such as to inspect `rustc
         --version` or to compile autocfg-style probe code.

    Cargo defines that build scripts run using the package's manifest directory
    as the current directory, so the rustc subprocess spawned from build.rs
    would also run in that manifest directory. But other rustc invocations
    performed by Buck run from the repo root.

    Rustup only looks at one rust-toolchain.toml file, using the nearest one
    present in any parent directory. The file can set `channel` to control which
    installed version of rustc to run.

    It is bad if it's possible for the rustc run by a build script vs rustc run
    by the rest of the build to be different toolchains. In order to configure
    their crate appropriately, build scripts rely on using the same rustc that
    their crate will be later compiled by.

    This problem doesn't happen during Cargo-based builds because rustup
    installs both a cargo shim and a rustc shim. When you run a rustup-managed
    Cargo, one of the first things it does is define a RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
    environment variable pointing to the rustup channel id of the currently
    selected cargo. Subsequent invocations of the rustup cargo shim or rustc
    shim with this variable in the environment no longer pay attention to any
    rust-toolchain.toml file.

    We cannot follow the same approach because there is no API in rustup for
    finding out a suitable RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN value consistent with which
    toolchain "rustc" currently refers to, and even if there were, it isn't
    guaranteed that "rustc" refers to a rustup-managed toolchain in the first
    place.
