//! The disk tree: what is on disk under buck-out, who may read or write it, and who is waiting
//! to.
//!
//! A trie over buck-out paths. A node may be a *tracked root*, a path whose content is known to
//! be on disk, held as its entry with an access time and a classification. A tracked directory
//! is one root: reads inside it resolve against the directory's contents, and a write strictly
//! inside it expands it into one root per child first, so that the rest stays tracked. A node
//! may also carry a *lease*, read or write, the requests waiting for one, and tasks left running
//! under a write that was released.
//!
//! A request is for one root and says what it wants there ([`Want`]): content the holder needs
//! to read, or a path it is about to write. Each time the request is examined, the tree answers
//! whether a content want is already satisfied (read mode) or the holder has to put the content
//! there itself (write mode). A write root is granted with its *exclusions*: the tracked roots
//! below it that already hold what the want has there. They stay tracked, everything else under
//! the root is untracked by the grant, and the holder may not touch them. So under a held write
//! root, tracked means excluded, and the invariant that ties the two halves together is: a root
//! is tracked only while nobody holds it for write, except what a write excludes, and read is
//! granted only on a match.
//!
//! Two roots conflict when they are not both reads and one is a prefix of, or equal to, the
//! other, except that a read strictly inside a write is fine when it lies on tracked, that is
//! excluded, content. A request that conflicts with a held root, or with a request that arrived
//! before it and is still waiting, waits. So a queued writer blocks readers that arrive after it
//! on its paths and cannot be starved by a stream of readers, and a request queued behind a
//! writer takes read mode once that writer has reported. A request waits only for requests that
//! arrived before it: whether two requests conflict at a root cannot change once the later one
//! has been granted, so the later one is never what the earlier one waits for.
//!
//! A grant is a [`Hold`], a token the tree alone creates, which ends only by going back into the
//! tree: [`DiskTree::report`] turns a write hold into a read hold, [`DiskTree::release_read`] and
//! [`DiskTree::release_write`] end one. Nothing here blocks, notifies or does IO. The tree is
//! owned by the materializer's processor thread, and every operation returns its [`Effects`]: the
//! grants it produced, each with the reply handle its requester left, and the change to the
//! tracked roots for the caller to mirror into sqlite. The reply handle is opaque to the tree.
