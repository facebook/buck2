Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [env: BUCK_VERBOSE=]
          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets

      --help-wrapper
          Print buck wrapper help
