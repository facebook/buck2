/// The Starlark representation of an `Artifact`
///
/// The following fields are available in Starlark:
/// `.basename`: The base name of this artifact. e.g. for an artifact
///              at `foo/bar`, this is `bar`
/// `.extension`: The file extension of this artifact. e.g. for an artifact at foo/bar.sh,
///               this is `sh`. If no extension is present, an empty string is returned
/// `.is_source`: Whether the artifact represents a source file
/// `.owner`: The `Label` of the rule that originally created this artifact. May also be None in
///           the case of source files, or if the artifact has not be used in an action.
/// `as_output()`: Returns a `StarlarkOutputArtifact` instance, or fails if the artifact is
///                either an `Artifact`, or is a bound `DeclaredArtifact` (You cannot bind twice)
/// `.short_path`: The interesting part of the path, relative to somewhere in the output directory.
///                For an artifact declared as `foo/bar`, this is `foo/bar`.
