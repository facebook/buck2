# This file is @generated, regenerate by re-running test with `-- --env BUCK2_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` appended to the test command

Display the values and origins of external configs for a selected command.

Buckconfigs are computed by joining together values from various inputs (repo, well-known
directories, CLI flags). Each of these is logged in the given order, with later components
overriding earlier ones. For config files originating from the repo (i.e. project-relative paths),
except .buckconfig.local, we log the path, not the actual values.

Usage: buck2 log external-configs [OPTIONS] [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]
          A path to an event-log file to read from

Options:
      --recent <NUMBER>
          Open the event-log file from a recent command

      --trace-id <ID>
          Show log by trace id

      --allow-remote
          This option does nothing

      --no-remote
          Do not allow downloading the log from manifold if it's not found locally

      --format <FORMAT>
          Which output format to use for this command

          [default: tabulated]
          [possible values: tabulated, json, csv]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Universal Options:
  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
