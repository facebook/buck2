   * The CreateSymbolicLinkW API on Windows returns
   * a BOOLEAN, which is really a byte in Java (8 bit numeric value).
   * At the JVM level, boolean, byte, short, char, and int are all treated as ints, and boolean is
   * indeed represented as 0 and 1. The API is successful if the return value is not 0.
   * So, returning 0xD0 should be a success, but the 0th bit is not set and Java will interpret this
   * as boolean false. This is fixed by making the function imported from native as a byte return
   * and compering the return value explicitly to 0.
   *
   * @param lpSymlinkFileName The new symlink name.
   * @param lpTargetFileName The existing file to link into.
   * @param dwFlags Whether it is a directiory.
   * @return Anh 8 bit integer which is interpreted as success if not 0, and failure as 0.
