/// We need to provide a 'static stream for Tonic to send to the Buck2 daemon,
/// but we don't want to borrow stdin statically (though in practice that
/// doesn't really matter because the way the command ends is when stdin is
/// empty). So, what we do instead is that we forward stdin only while the
/// command is ongoing.
///
/// The `hangup` parameter allows producing a message to the server when stdin
/// ends. The `hangup_timeout` parameter allows returning a fallback result
/// after stdin ends and the optional hangup message has been sent. If it
/// returns `None`, this helper stays pending after EOF and relies on the work
/// future to finish independently.
///
/// Note that the tx/rx channel pair is used by us to send messages to the
/// remote/RPC service implemented by `f`. If `f` causes that channel to close,
/// the state machine will transition to `RxClosed`, and wait forever. It's
/// imperative that the caller's `f` function complete in these cases and return
/// the overall status of the command. We do not propagate errors from the closure
