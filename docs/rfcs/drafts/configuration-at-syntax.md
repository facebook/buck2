# @configuration syntax

## What

Command

```shell
buck2 build //foo:bar@config//platform:linux-x86_64
```

should be equivalent to current syntax:

```shell
buck2 build //foo:bar --target-platforms=//platform:linux-x86_64
```

## Why

Might be convenient if we define global
(or per-target, as proposed in
[target configuration discovery RFC](https://www.internalfb.com/diff/D35135886))
alias. For example, if there's an alias

```
release=//config:linux-x86_64-release
```

The command above can be expressed as:

```shell
buck2 build //foo:bar@release
```

Additionally, if we have
[configuration expression RFC](https://www.internalfb.com/diff/D35135496) implemented,
we can do something like:

```shell
buck2 build //foo:bar@release+gcc
```

## Possible future extensions

For now, at-syntax only applies to command line arguments
* of `build`/`targets`/`run`/`test` commands
* probably `cquery` query

It would be reasonable to expect that this syntax should be allowed anywhere we need
a target (e.g. in `deps` attribute), but this is out of scope of this proposal.
