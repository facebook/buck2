load("@prelude//utils:arglike.bzl", "ArgLike")  # @unused Used as a type

# Types in this file represent a contract between a BXL script (see fdb.bxl) and internal debugging tool.
# These most likely will change as the BXL integration evolves over time to be more generic
# Right now the internal tool is making a call "buck2 bxl @mode prelude//debugging:fdb.bxl --target //some_target --arg=arg1 --arg=2"
# And fdb.bxl is expected to output artifact with serialized ExecInfo
# This information will be used to build debug configuration (primarily VSCode launch configuration but in some cases CLI invocations or Android Studio requests)

# This type represents strongly typed contract used by "fdb.bxl" script arguments.
# Even though arguments are available in "bxl_ctx", when using ctx.dynamic_output it's not possible to access arguments from there
# One way to work this around is by capturing an object in a closure and this type is used to carry the contract for this object
