/**
 * This class sets up a separate ClassLoader for most of Buck's implementation, leaving only the
 * bare minimum bootstrapping classes (and a few classes for compatibility with library code that is
 * not ClassLoader-aware) in the system ClassLoader. This is done so that annotation processors do
 * not have their classpaths polluted with Buck's dependencies when Buck is compiling Java code
 * in-process.
 *
 * <p>Under JSR-199, when the Java compiler is run in-process it uses a ClassLoader that is a child
 * of the system ClassLoader. In order for annotation processors to access the Compiler Tree API
 * (which lives in tools.jar with the compiler itself), they must be loaded with a ClassLoader
 * descended from the compiler's. If Buck used the system ClassLoader as a normal Java application
 * would, this would result in annotation processors getting Buck's versions of Guava, Jackson, etc.
 * instead of their own.
