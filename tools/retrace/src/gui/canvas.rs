//! The timeline: culled bar painting with in-bar activity coverage, the
//! time ruler, the concurrency strip, the lane gutter, the minimap with
//! its viewport brush, scrollbars, hover/click, and keyboard
//! navigation. Bars carry the parse-time class colors; wide-enough bars
//! re-read their record lazily (budgeted per frame) to draw the
