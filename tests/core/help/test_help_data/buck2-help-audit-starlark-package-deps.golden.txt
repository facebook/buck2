Inspect Starlark package file all bzl dependencies by package name like foo//bar/baz

Usage: buck2 audit starlark package-deps [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE>

Arguments:
  <PACKAGE>
          Package

Options:
  -m, --modifier <VALUE>
          This option is not used

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Buckconfig Options:
  -c, --config <SECTION.OPTION=VALUE>
          List of config options

      --config-file <PATH>
          List of config file paths

      --fake-host <HOST>
          [possible values: default, linux, macos, windows]

      --fake-arch <ARCH>
          [possible values: default, aarch64, x8664]

      --fake-xcode-version <VERSION-BUILD>
          Value must be formatted as: version-build (e.g., 14.3.0-14C18 or 14.1-14B47b)

      --reuse-current-config
          Re-uses any `--config` values (inline or via modefiles) if there's a previous command,
          otherwise the flag is ignored.

          If there is a previous command and `--reuse-current-config` is set, then the old config is
          used, ignoring any overrides.

          If there is no previous command but the flag was set, then the flag is ignored, the
          command behaves as if the flag was not set at all.

      --preemptible <PREEMPTIBLE>
          Used to configure when this command could be preempted by another command for the same
          isolation dir.

          Normally, when you run two commands - from different terminals, say - buck2 will attempt
          to run them in parallel. However, if the two commands are based on different state, that
          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run
          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until
          the first completes.

          Possible values:
          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with
            this one, block that command
          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they
            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides
            slightly nicer superconsole output
          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,
            interrupt this command

      --exit-when <EXIT_WHEN>
          Whether to proceed with or fail this invocation based on the daemon state

          Possible values:
          - never:          (default) Execute this command normally
          - differentstate: Fail this command if another command is already running with a different
            state
          - notidle:        Fail this command if another command is already running (regardless of
            daemon state)

Starlark Options:
      --disable-starlark-types
          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.

          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance
          problems.

      --stack
          Record or show target call stacks.

          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.

          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be
          printed after the targets.

      --profile-patterns <PROFILE_PATTERNS>
          Enables profiling for all evaluations whose evaluation identifier matches one of the
          provided patterns.

          Some examples identifiers: analysis/cell//buck2/app/buck2_action_impl:buck2_action_impl
          (cfg:linux-x86_64#27ac5723e0c99706) load/cell//build_defs/json.bzl
          load/prelude//playground/test.bxl load/cell//build_defs/json.bzl@other_cell
          load_buildfile/fbcode//third-party-buck/platform010/build/ncurses
          load_packagefile/fbcode//cli/rust/cli_delegate anon_analysis/anon//:_anon_link_rule (anon:
          766183dc9b6f680a) (fbcode//buck2/platform/execution:linux-x86_64#08961b14cfb182aa)
          bxl/prelude//playground/test.bxl:playground

          You can pass `--profile-patterns=.*` to enable no-op profiling for everything
          (additionally pass `--profile-patterns-mode=none` to use no-op profiling to just get a
          list of all the identifiers).

          The profile results will be written to individual .profile files in
          `<ROOT_OUTPUT>/<data+time>-<uuid>/` where ROOT_OUTPUT comes from the
          --profile-patterns-output flag. In that directory there will also be a file listing all
          the identifiers that were profiled.

          Enabling/disabling profiling of an evaluation will invalidate the results of that
          evaluation and it will be recomputed. In some cases, this will cause other work to also
          need to be redone (for example, invalidating the result of loading PACKAGE files causes
          all consumers to be recomputed). But if you keep profiling options consistent between
          commands, only the work that is otherwise invalidated will be redone (and only for those
          would profiling results be created).

          You must also pass --profile-patterns-mode and --profile-patterns-output.

      --profile-patterns-output <PATH>


      --profile-patterns-mode <PROFILE_PATTERNS_MODE>
          Profile mode.

          Memory profiling modes have suffixes either `-allocated` or `-retained`.

          `-retained` means memory kept in frozen starlark heaps after analysis completes.
          `-retained` does not work when profiling loading, because no memory is retained after
          loading and frozen heap is not even created. This is probably what you want when profiling
          analysis.

          `-allocated` means allocated memory, including memory which is later garbage collected.

          [possible values: time-flame, heap-allocated, heap-retained, heap-flame-allocated,
          heap-flame-retained, heap-summary-allocated, heap-summary-retained, statement, bytecode,
          bytecode-pairs, typecheck, coverage, none]

Console Options:
      --console <super|simple|...>
          Which console to use for this command

          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, none, simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super]

      --ui <UI>...
          Configure additional superconsole ui components.

          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add. Possible values are:

          dice - shows information about evaluated dice nodes debugevents - shows information about
          the flow of events from buckd

          These components can be turned on/off interactively. Press 'h' for help when superconsole
          is active.

          Possible values:
          - dice
          - debugevents
          - io:          I/O panel
          - re:          RE panel

      --no-interactive-console
          Disable console interactions

          [env: BUCK_NO_INTERACTIVE_CONSOLE=]

Event Log Options:
      --event-log <PATH>
          Write events to this log file

      --write-build-id <PATH>
          Write command invocation id into this file

      --unstable-write-invocation-record <PATH>
          Write the invocation record (as JSON) to this path. No guarantees whatsoever are made
          regarding the stability of the format

      --command-report-path <PATH>
          Write the command report to this path. A command report is always written to
          `buck-out/v2/<uuid>/command_report` even without this flag

Universal Options:
      --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>
          The name of the directory that Buck2 creates within buck-out for writing outputs and
          daemon information. If one is not provided, Buck2 creates a directory with the default
          name.

          Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.
          The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a
          result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds).

          [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=]
          [default: v2]

  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [env: BUCK_VERBOSE=]
          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
