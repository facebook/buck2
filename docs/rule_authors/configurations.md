title: Configurations
---

This page mostly focuses on how configurations and related features are
implemented. A good understanding of the high-level
[concepts](../concepts/configurations.md) is therefore required.

## Defining platforms

A platform is simply a target with at least a
[`PlatformInfo`](../api/build/PlatformInfo/). That target can be an
instance of a custom rule, or it can simply use the prelude's
[`platform`](../prelude/rules/core/platform/) rule:

```python
platform(
    name = "my_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        "//constraints:build_mode[debug]",
        "//constraints:cpu[x64]",
    ],
)
```

The configuration is actually part of the analysis result of the
platform target (the
[`ConfigurationInfo`](../api/build/ConfigurationInfo/) provider
instance). This is convenient from an implementation standpoint, but it
leads to a situation where some nodes are analyzed with an "unbound"
Configuration.

All the rule types involved in defining a platform may be analyzed with an
unbound configuration (`platform()`, `config_setting()`, `constraint_setting()`,
and so on). These are sometimes called "configuration rules". This means that
all the attributes of these rules are not selectable.

Configurations also reference a few other provider instances such as
`ConstraintSettingInfo`. All of these end up being potentially produced in a
context with an unbound configuration.

Using analysis for this also means that "configuration" and "analysis" are not
distinct phases within a build (although they are still distinct for a node and
are still conceptually useful).

There are three main concepts to understand about execution platforms:

1. Execution platforms
2. Execution deps
3. Execution platform resolution

### Execution platforms

The simplest execution platform setup is the one `buck2 init` uses. This
setup gathers constraints from the host machine Buck is running on.

```ini
[parser]
  target_platform_detector_spec = target:root//...->prelude//platforms:default
[build]
  execution_platforms = prelude//platforms:default
```

For many projects, this will suffice, and your target and execution
platform will be the same (until you provide a config modifier, which
applies only to the target platform). But the target/exec distinction
forms the basis of all kinds of cross compilation and remote build
execution. You can use these to express "I want to compile code that
will eventually run on Windows, but all the build tools and compilers
should run on my local Linux computer". In that case the target platform
is Windows, and the execution platform is Linux. You can imagine exotic
situations in which the compiler itself has to be compiled first, on yet
another execution platform.

More complex setups are possible. You can:

- Add more constraints and configure code differently when it will be
  executed in a build step (e.g. release mode, for faster builds of
  everything else).
- Set up cross compilation, in conjunction with toolchains that will
  provide the right flags.
- Let buck automatically select from multiple execution platforms
  depending on what's being built (for example, most of the build can be
  done on Linux, but the linker might only run on Windows).

#### Custom execution platforms

The process for fully specifying your own execution platforms is:

1. Create a target that exposes an
   `ExecutionPlatformRegistrationInfo(platforms = [...])` provider. Each
   platform is an `ExecutionPlatformInfo`, which has its own
   `ConfigurationInfo` (a set of constraints describing it, e.g. it's an
   x86 server running Linux). This `ConfigurationInfo` is used for exec
   platform resolution/compatibility, and also to configure software
   that will run there. So often you will tell it you want all build
   tools to be built themselves in release mode, so your builds are
   faster.
2. Configure the `build.execution_platforms` value in your `.buckconfig`
   to point to this target:

    ```ini
    [build]
    execution_platforms = platforms//:my_exec_platforms
    ```

Here’s an example definition of execution platforms.

```python
execution_platform(
    name = "mac-exec",
    platform = "//platforms:mac-arm64-opt",
    local_enabled = host_info().os.is_macos,
    remote_enabled = True,
    use_limited_hybrid = False,
    remote_execution_use_case = "buck2-build",
    remote_execution_properties = {
        "platform": "mac-re"
    },
)

execution_platform(
    name = "windows-exec",
    platform = "//platforms:windows-arm64-opt",
    local_enabled = host_info().os.is_windows,
    ...
)

execution_platform(
    name = "linux-exec",
    ...
)

execution_platforms(
    name = "exec-platforms",
    # In practice, may want to change this order based on the host os.
    platforms = [
        "linux-exec",
        "windows-exec",
        "mac-exec",
    ],
    fallback = "error",
)
```

This sets us up with three execution platforms, one for each of Windows,
macOS, and Linux. We choose a more optimized configuration for that
platform (i.e. `opt` instead of `dev`). Generally for build tools we
recommend using an optimized form, as most of the time the build will be
executing the prebuilt tools rather than building them.

In simple cases you will only have one execution platform, and the story
ends there.

In more complex cases, you may have multiple execution platforms. For
example, you may have a remote build farm that has both Linux and
Windows machines. When a build is requested for a particular configured
target, Buck will iterate the platforms provided in the registration
provider, and select the first platform whose configuration matches the
execution constraints. Basically, some build tools only run on Linux, so
if the tools need to be built, Buck will configure them to be built for
Linux, and then when it comes time to run them, it will schedule them to
run under the Linux execution platform. Other build tools (a
cross-platform python script) could run anywhere and these will not
influence the choice of exec platform for a given target. The
`ExecutionPlatformInfo` provider that is ultimately chosen supplies
key-value data that is sent to the remote build farm that can be used to
comply with the request, like `"OSFamily": "linux"` or a given Docker
image. You could have dozens of auto-generated execution platforms, or a
few well-known platforms that are maintained and rotated as you migrate
infrastructure over time.

### Execution deps

Some target deps are "execution deps". These are the dependencies of the
target that should be built for the execution platform. For example, a
compiler or other build tool would be an execution dep. This includes
all exe [string parameter macro](./string_parameter_macros.md) deps (for
example, `$(exe //:tool)`) and includes all `attrs.exec_dep()` deps.

An exec dep differs in two ways from a normal dep:

1. Its target platform will be set to the resolved exec platform of the
   dependent. Normal deps simply inherit the target platform.
2. It influences which exec platform is chosen for a dependent target.
   This is covered in exec platform resolution below.

Aside from the way they interact with dependents, exec deps are regular
targets in the build graph. They may themselves be compiled using their
own `exec_dep`s, and therefore may need to select their own exec platform
based on their own exec deps. Each time a target somewhere in the build
graph has `exec_dep`s, Buck will do another transition through exec
platform resolution.

You might not notice an incorrectly typed dependency edge if your only
registered execution platform = your target platform = your host machine
and you don't do much build configuration, but it matters once you start
writing your own build tools and compiling for platforms other than your
host machine. The typical error when you have misconfigured is "exec
format error" on Linux, where Buck is trying to execute e.g. a Windows
executable on a Linux machine.

### Execution platform resolution

During analysis, unlike target platform resolution, every configured node
undergoes execution platform resolution independently (see exception below).
This means that even for a specific target platform, different nodes in the
graph can be built on different execution platforms.

This works roughly as follows:

```python
next: for platform in execution_platforms:
    if exec_compatible_with(target, platform):
        for dep in target.execution_deps():
            if !target_compatible_with(dep, platform):
              continue next
        return platform
return err
```

One important note here is that until the execution platform has been resolved,
**the configuration for execution deps is not known**. Only after execution
platform has been resolved can the execution deps be configured (also, analysis
for them can only be performed at that point).

For the normal use case, a particular configured target node performs execution
platform resolution a single time. The execution platform **is not** encoded in
output paths.

Regarding target compatibility, imagine the following pseudo-code for the
`target_compatible_with()` function above:

```python
def target_compatible_with(target, cfg):
    for constraint in target.target_compatible_with:
        if not satisfied(constraint, cfg):
            return False

    if len(target.compatible_with) > 0:
        found_satisfied_constraint = False
        for constraint in target.compatible_with:
            if satisfied(constraint, cfg):
                found_satisfied_constraint = True
                break
        if not found_satisfied_constraint:
            return False

    for (dep, dep_cfg) in direct_deps(target):
        # NB: recursive call
        if not target_compatible_with(dep, dep_cfg):
            return False

    return True
```

## Toolchain deps

In addition to `attrs.exec_dep()`, there is also
`attrs.toolchain_dep()`. Toolchain deps must always point to an instance
of a [toolchain rule](../concepts/toolchain.md). They are much like
[macros](custom_macros.md) for adding one or more exec deps, configuring
them a little, and storing them in a convenient provider structure.

This intuition holds when considering configuration, as toolchains and
macros share two main properties:

1. Toolchain deps have the same target platform as whatever uses them.
   So if you `select()` in the parameters to a toolchain rule, you match
   on how the dependent target was configured. Many toolchain rules
   allow you to set defaults or base flags for a given target platform
   in this way.
2. Toolchain deps are invisible to exec platform resolution of the
   dependent target, so that the exec deps of the toolchain act as if
   they are attached directly to the dependent target. They then
   participate in exec platform resolution for the dependent: Buck finds
   an exec platform for the dependent that is compatible with all the
   tools in the toolchain.

This has many benefits:

- It saves you from having to put the same few `attrs.exec_dep()`s on a
  bunch of different rules for the same programming language.
- It "delays" the exec_dep transition and provides a point of
  configurability before this happens.
- It bundles all configurability into one spot. The user can instantiate
  a toolchain at a known location (usually `toolchains//:languagename`)
  that includes exec deps or paths to binaries and configures it all in
  one go.

Toolchain targets don't select their execution platform, but instead
inherit the execution platform of whatever target references them. In
some sense, execution platform resolution sees _through_ them.

This is illustrated in the following example:

```python
some_regular_rule(
    name = "A",
    toolchain = attrs.toolchain_dep(default = ":B"),
)

some_toolchain_rule(
    name = "B",
    tool = attrs.exec_dep(default = ":C")
)
```

The above means that `:C` will be an execution dependency of `:A` and any
`select()`s defined in `:B` would be evaluated against the same target platform
as `:A` (as target platform gets inherited by `attrs.toolchain_dep()`s).

## Visualizing configuration concepts

### Graph with deps

![Example graph with dependencies](/img/configurations/graph_with_deps.png)

### Splitting //:lib3

As we work out the configurations here, `//:lib3` will end up being in two
different configurations, so gonna be easiest to split it now.

### Execution Platform resolution

![Example graph with dependencies](/img/configurations/execution_platform_resolution.png)

This shows which nodes are involved in determining the exec configuration for
the `//:binary` target. The exec deps of `//:binary` and the exec deps for the
(transitive) toolchain deps of `//:binary` are the main things involved, that set
of exec deps must all be target compatible with an execution platform for it to
be selected. In addition, the target itself and its toolchain deps must be
`exec_compatible_with`. It is very rare to use `exec_compatible_with`, for the most
part exec platform restrictions should be marked on the tools that require the
restriction.
