# A "fake" linker command meant to be provided to rustc as `-Clinker={}`. This script extracts
# from rustc's linker invocation the link inputs that only rustc can provide — the objects it
# synthesized for this crate — and exports them as outputs to later be consumed by the cxx-driven
# link of this crate.
#
# Everything else on the argv is discarded: the link is performed by cxx, and every flag and
# library it needs is provided by the toolchain and the dependency graph, the same way it is for
# a `cxx_binary`. See `process_link_args()` for the exact contract.

    When the argv would exceed the OS command-line limit (which a Rust link

    arguments in a single `@file`, one argument per line. Three formats are
    seen in the wild:
     - UTF-16 with each argument quoted and embedded quotes doubled, for
       msvc-flavored linkers;
     - UTF-8 with the same quoting, for direct (non-cc-driver) linkers
       invoked on a Windows host, e.g. wasm-ld;
     - UTF-8 with backslashes and spaces escaped by a backslash, for
       gcc-flavored linkers.
    The quoted forms leave backslashes raw, so quoting is detected per line
    before falling back to backslash-unescaping. A backslash-escaped line
    can never begin with a bare quote (it would be written as `\\"`), so the
    detection is unambiguous.

    The only args retained are wasm-ld `--export` args, which carry the same
    per-program symbol metadata that `symbols.o` does on ELF (see the comment
    at the branch). All other flags and libraries rustc puts on its link line
