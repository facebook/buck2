//! Optional OpenTelemetry (OTLP) export.
//!
//! When an OTLP endpoint is configured via the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` environment
//! variables, this module builds an OTLP exporter and tracer provider. Unlike a server, buck2 is a
//! short-lived CLI process, so the exported resource attributes describe *this invocation* (a fresh
//! `service.instance.id` per run, the compiled-in `service.version`, the host and pid) rather than a
//! long-running deployment.
//!
//! This module owns only the exporter lifecycle (build, activate, flush). What gets exported is up
//! to callers: anything that reaches the global provider stored here -- a `tracing` layer bridged on
//! top, or an out-of-band "wide event" span -- rides the same exporter.
//!
//! ## Environment variables
//!
//! We honor the standard OpenTelemetry environment variables so buck2 slots into an existing
//! telemetry setup without buck2-specific configuration:
//!
//! * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` -- endpoint, headers, timeout, compression, TLS. Read by the exporter
//!   builder itself; we only check the two endpoint variables to decide *whether* to export.
//! * `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` -- the spec's global kill-switch. `opentelemetry-rust` does not honor
//!   it on its own, so we check it here and skip building the exporter entirely.
//! * `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` / `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` -- extra/overriding resource attributes,
//!   merged in by `resource`. Our own authoritative attributes (pid, arch, os, host) win on
//!   conflict; `service.name` defaults to `buck2` but yields to a user-provided value.
//! * `TRACEPARENT` / `TRACESTATE` -- W3C Trace Context of the launching process (CI job, wrapper
//!   script, ...). When present, our wide-event span is parented under that trace instead of being
//!   a disconnected root. See [`export_span`].
//!
//! ## Deferred activation (important)
//!
//! The OTLP batch exporter spawns background threads (a batch-processor thread plus an HTTP client
//! runtime). The buck2 daemon daemonizes via `fork()` *without* a following `exec()`, and `fork()`
//! only copies the calling thread -- any other thread vanishes in the child but leaves the locks and
//! state it held (allocator, TLS/crypto, exporter queues) permanently wedged. A daemon that spawned
//! these threads pre-fork therefore deadlocks or aborts shortly after start. See the
//! "Do not create any threads before this point" invariant in `buck2_daemon::daemon`.
//!
//! So we do *not* build the exporter when the subscriber is installed. [`activate`] builds it later,
//! once the process is past any such `fork()`. Today only the client calls [`activate`] -- it emits
//! the invocation record and never `fork()`s-without-`exec()`. If the daemon ever exports its own
//! spans it must call [`activate`] only after it has finished daemonizing, never before.
//!
//! ## Flushing
//!
//! Spans are buffered and only flushed periodically. buck2 exits via `libc::_exit` (see
//! `ExitResult::report`), which runs no destructors, so the buffered batch would be dropped unless
//! we drain it explicitly. [`shutdown`] does that drain and must be called on every exit path. See
//! <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/1961>.
