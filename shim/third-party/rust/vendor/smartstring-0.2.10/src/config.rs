/// A compact string representation equal to [`String`] in size with guaranteed inlining.
///
/// This representation relies on pointer alignment to be able to store a discriminant bit in its
/// inline form that will never be present in its [`String`] form, thus
/// giving us 24 bytes on 64-bit architectures, and 12 bytes on 32-bit, minus one bit, to encode our
/// inline string. It uses the rest of the discriminant bit's byte to encode the string length, and
/// the remaining bytes (23 or 11 depending on arch) to store the string data. When the available space is exceeded,
/// it swaps itself out with a [`String`] containing its previous
/// contents, relying on the discriminant bit in the [`String`]'s pointer to be unset, so we can
/// store the [`String`] safely without taking up any extra space for a discriminant.
///
/// This performs generally as well as [`String`] on all ops on boxed strings, and
/// better than [`String`]s on inlined strings.

/// inlined string if it should become short enough, [`LazyCompact`] keeps
/// it heap allocated once heap allocation has occurred. If your aim is to defer heap
/// allocation as much as possible, rather than to ensure cache locality, this is the
/// variant you want - it won't allocate until the inline capacity is exceeded, and it
/// also won't deallocate once allocation has occurred, which risks reallocation if the
