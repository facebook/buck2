# Rule APIs

When implementing a rule, you are given a value of type `context` and are expected to produce providers. This document lays out the types reachable from that.

## Providers

* `DefaultInfo(default_outputs : ["artifact"], other_outputs : [["artifact", "cmd_args"]] = [], sub_targets : {str.type: ["provider"]} = {})` is the provider that is used for `buck2 build` (it builds everything in `default_outputs` and `other_outputs`), `$(location)` (it uses the `default_outputs`) and for `buck2 build my_target[foo]` (it selects the `foo` value from `sub_targets`).
  * Note: if you use `cmd_args` in `other_outputs`, then that will expand to all the inputs referenced by the `cmd_args` you provide.

* `RunInfo(args)` is the provider that is used for `buck2 run`, where `args` is anything that can be converted into `cmd_args`, including a command line itself.

* `ExternalRunnerTestInfo(...)` which will be explored in [Test Execution](test_execution.md)

## Type `context`

The starting type, usually bound as `ctx`.

* `ctx.attr` returns the attributes of the target as a Starlark dictionary indexed by the name of the attribute, which varies per rule.
* `ctx.actions` returns a `actions` allowing you to define actions.
* `ctx.label` returns a `label` representing the target.

## Type `actions`

* `ctx.actions.declare_output([prefix], filename)` returns an `artifact` with the name `filename`, which when asked for its name, will return `filename` (which may include a directory portion). The optional parameter `prefix` provides a silent part of the filename, which can be used to disambiguate, but whose presence will not be visible to anyone using the `artifact`. The main use for `declare_output` is to produce an unbound artifact for passing to `ctx.actions.run`.

* `ctx.actions.write(filename, content, is_executable : bool.type = false, allow_args : bool.type = false)` returns an `artifact` whose contents are `content`. The `filename` can either be a string, or an existing artifact created with `declare_output`. The optional parameter `is_executable` says whether the resulting file should be marked with executable permissions. The optional parameter `allow_args` must be set to `True` if you want to write parameter arguments to the file, in particular macros which write to file and if it is true, the result will be a pair of the `artifact` containing `content` and a list of `artifact` values that were written by macros, and should be used in hidden fields or similar.

* `ctx.actions.write_json(filename, content)` returns an `artifact` whose contents are `content` written as a JSON value. The `filename` can either be a string, or an existing artifact created with `declare_output`. The `content` value must be composed of the basic json types (boolean, number, string, list/tuple, dictionary) plus artifacts and command lines. An artifact will be written as a string containing the path. A command line will be written as a list of strings, unless `joined=True` is set, in which case it will be a string.

* `ctx.actions.copy_file(dest, src)` copies the source `artifact` to the destination (which can be a string representing a filename or an output `artifact`) and returns the output `artifact`. The copy works for files or directories.

* `ctx.actions.symlink_file(dest, src)` creates a symlink to the source `artifact` at the destination (which can be a string representing a filename or an output `artifact`) and returns the output `artifact`. The symlink works for files or directories.

* `ctx.actions.symlinked_dir(output, srcs : {str.type: "artifact"})` returns an artifact which is a directory containing symlinks. The `srcs` must be a dictionary of path (as string, relative to the result directory) to bound `artifact` which will be laid out in the directory.

* `ctx.actions.copied_dir(output, srcs : {str.type: "artifact"}, copy : bool.type = false)` returns an artifact which is a directory containing copied files. The `srcs` must be a dictionary of path (as string, relative to the result directory) to bound `artifact` which will be laid out in the directory.

* `ctx.actions.download_file(output, url : str.type, sha1: str.type, is_executable : bool.type = false)` download a URL to an output (filename as string or output `artifact`). The file at the URL must have the given `sha1` or the command will fail. The optional parameter `is_executable` says whether the resulting file should be marked with executable permissions.

* `ctx.actions.run(arguments, category : str.type, identifier : str.type = "", env : {str.type: str.type} = {}, local_only : bool.type = false, always_print_stderr : bool.type = false, weight : int.type = 1, metadata_env_var: str.type = None, metadata_path: str.type = None, no_outputs_cleanup: bool.type = false)` runs a command.
  - The `arguments` must be of type `cmd_args`, or a type convertible to such (e.g. list of strings and artifacts), and must contain at least one `.as_output()` artifact.
  - The `category` and `identifier` will together be used to identify the action in Buck2's event stream, and must be unique for a given target.
  - The `weight` is used to note how heavy the command is, and will typically be set to a higher value to indicate that less such commands should be run in parallel (if running locally).
  - If `no_outputs_cleanup` flag is set then Buck2 won't clean the outputs of a previous build which might be present on a disk and command from `arguments` should be responsible for a cleanup in such case (that is useful e.g. when action is supporting incremental mode and its outputs are based on result from previous build).
  - `metadata_env_var` and `metadata_path` parameters should either be both set or both unset. `metadata_path` defines path relative to the result directory for a file with action metadata which will be created right before the command will be run. Metadata contains path relative to Buck2 project root and hash digest for every action input. That excludes symlinks as those could be resolved by user script if needed. Resolved path relative to Buck2 project for metadata file will be passed to command from `arguments` via environment variable with name set by `metadata_env_var` parameter. Both `metadata_env_var` and `metadata_path` parameters are useful when making actions behave in incremental manner, see [Incremental Actions](./incremental_actions.md) for details.

* `ctx.actions.tset(type, value = None, children = None)` creates a new transitive set. See [Transitive Sets](./transitive_sets.md) for details.

## Type `cmd_args`

The `cmd_args` type is created by `cmd_args` and is consumed by `ctx.actions.run`. The type is a mutable collection of strings and `artifact` values. In general, command lines, artifacts, strings, `RunInfo` and lists thereof can be added to or used to construct a `cmd_args` value. All these methods operate mutably on `cmd` and return that value too.

* `cmd_args(*args, format: str.type = "", delimiter: str.type = None, prepend: str.type = None, quote: str.type = None)` creates and returns a `cmd_args` type.
  * The `*args` parameter is a list of things to add to the command line, each of which must be coercible to a command line. Further items can be added with `cmd.add`.
  * The optional `format` parameter is a string which provides a format to apply to the argument. As examples `cmd_args(x, format="--args={}")` would prepend `--args=` before `x`, or if `x` was a list, before each element in `x`.
  * The optional `delimiter` parameter is added between argumentsto join them together. For example `cmd_args(["--args=",x], delimiter="")` would produce a single argument to the underlying tool.
  * The optional `prepend` parameter is added as a separate argument before each argument.
  * The optional `quote` parameter says whether quoting is to be applied to each argument - the only current valid value is `"shell"`.

* `cmd.add(*args)` a list of arguments to be added to the command line, as per `cmd_args`.

* `cmd.hidden(*args)` things to add to the command line which do not show up, but are added as dependencies.

* `cmd.ignore_artifacts()` is conceptually the opposite of `hidden()`, it causes none of the arguments of the command line to be added as dependencies. Use this is you need to the path to an artifact but *not* the artifact itself. Note that if you do find yourself needing any of the inputs referenced by this command you will hit build errors due to misssing dependencies.

* `cmd.relative_to(directory, parent : int.type = 0)` complex magic. Don't use without talking to us.

* `cmd.absolute_prefix(prefix : str.type)` add a prefix to the front of every artifact.

* `cmd.absolute_suffix(suffix : str.type)` add a suffix to the end of every artifact.

* `cmd.parent(count : int.type = 1)` use the parent of all given artifacts. Often used as `cmd_args(artifact, format="-L{}").parent()`.

* `cmd.copy()` returns a copy of the `cmd_args` such that any modifications to the original or the returned value will not impact each other.

* `cmd.inputs` returns a list of the artifacts that are inputs to this command line.

* `cmd.outputs` returns a list of the artifacts that are outputs of this command line.

## Type `label`

A label represents a configured target. For example, given the label `fbcode//buck2/hello:world (ovr_config//platform/linux:x86_64-fbcode-46b26edb4b80a905)` it has the following attributes:

* `package` gives back `buck2/hello`
* `name` gives back `world`
* `sub_target` gives back `None`
* `path` gives back `fbcode/buck2/hello`
* `cell` gives back `fbcode`
* `raw_target()` gives back `fbcode//buck2/hello:world` without the configuration

## Type `artifact`

An artifact, which has a location on disk. Some of that location is considered private, and some (the suffix) is available for use. The examples below assume an artifact such as one created with `ctx.actions.declare_output("hello/world.txt")`. It has the following attributes:

* `basename` gives back `world.txt`
* `extension` gives back `.txt`
* `is_source` - `True` if the artifact is a source, otherwise `False`.
* `owner` gives back a `label` representing the rule that created it (if it is a build output)  or `None` (if it is a source).
* `as_output()` gives a value suitable for setting as an output to `ctx.actions.run`.
* `short_path` gives back `hello/world.txt`
