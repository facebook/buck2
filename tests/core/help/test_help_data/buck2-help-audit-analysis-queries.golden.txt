buck audit analysis resolving query attrs

Usage: buck2 audit analysis-queries [OPTIONS] [TARGET_PATTERNS]...

Arguments:
  [TARGET_PATTERNS]...
          Patterns to evaluate. The query attributes for targets matching these patterns will be
          evaluated

Options:
      --include-outputs
          Enable to print the outputs for the targets in the resolved queries

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Target Configuration Options:
  -u, --target-universe <TARGET_UNIVERSE>
          Comma separated list of targets to construct a configured target universe.

          When the option is specified, command targets are be resolved in this universe.
          Additionally, `--target-platforms=` and `--modifier=` flags are be used to configure the
          universe targets, not the command targets.

          This argument is particularly recommended on most non-trivial cqueries. In the absence of
          this argument, buck2 will use the target literals in your cquery expression as the value
          for this argument, which may not be what you want.

      --target-platforms <PLATFORM>
          Configuration target (one) to use to configure targets

  -m, --modifier <VALUE>
          A configuration modifier to configure all targets on the command line. This may be a
          constraint value target.

Buckconfig Options:
  -c, --config <SECTION.OPTION=VALUE>
          List of config options

      --config-file <PATH>
          List of config file paths

      --fake-host <HOST>
          [possible values: default, linux, macos, windows]

      --fake-arch <ARCH>
          [possible values: default, aarch64, x8664]

      --fake-xcode-version <VERSION-BUILD>
          Value must be formatted as: version-build (e.g., 14.3.0-14C18 or 14.1-14B47b)

      --reuse-current-config
          Re-uses any `--config` values (inline or via modefiles) if there's a previous command,
          otherwise the flag is ignored.

          If there is a previous command and `--reuse-current-config` is set, then the old config is
          used, ignoring any overrides.

          If there is no previous command but the flag was set, then the flag is ignored, the
          command behaves as if the flag was not set at all.

      --exit-when-different-state
          Used for exiting a concurrent command when a different state is detected

      --preemptible <PREEMPTIBLE>
          Used to configure when this command could be preempted by another command for the same
          isolation dir.

          Normally, when you run two commands - from different terminals, say - buck2 will attempt
          to run them in parallel. However, if the two commands are based on different state, that
          is they either have different configs or different filesystem states, buck2 cannot run
          them in parallel. The default behavior in this case is to block the second command until
          the first completes.

          Possible values:
          - never:            (default) When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with
            this one, block that command
          - always:           When another command starts, interrupt this command, *even if they
            could run in parallel*. There is no good reason to use this other than that it provides
            slightly nicer superconsole output
          - ondifferentstate: When another command starts that cannot run in parallel with this one,
            interrupt this command

Starlark Options:
      --disable-starlark-types
          Disable runtime type checking in Starlark interpreter.

          This option is not stable, and can be used only locally to diagnose evaluation performance
          problems.

      --stack
          Record or show target call stacks.

          Starlark call stacks will be included in duplicate targets error.

          If a command outputs targets (like `targets` command), starlark call stacks will be
          printed after the targets.

Console Options:
      --console <super|simple|...>
          Which console to use for this command

          [env: BUCK_CONSOLE=]
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, none, simple, simplenotty, simpletty, super]

      --ui <UI>...
          Configure additional superconsole ui components.

          Accepts a comma-separated list of superconsole components to add. Possible values are:

          dice - shows information about evaluated dice nodes debugevents - shows information about
          the flow of events from buckd

          These components can be turned on/off interactively. Press 'h' for help when superconsole
          is active.

          Possible values:
          - dice
          - debugevents
          - io:          I/O panel
          - re:          RE panel

      --no-interactive-console
          Disable console interactions

          [env: BUCK_NO_INTERACTIVE_CONSOLE=]

Event Log Options:
      --event-log <PATH>
          Write events to this log file

      --write-build-id <PATH>
          Write command invocation id into this file

      --unstable-write-invocation-record <PATH>
          Write the invocation record (as JSON) to this path. No guarantees whatsoever are made
          regarding the stability of the format

      --command-report-path <PATH>
          Write the command report to this path. A command report is always written to
          `buck-out/v2/<uuid>/command_report` even without this flag

Universal Options:
  -v, --verbose <VERBOSITY>
          How verbose buck should be while logging.

          Values: 0 = Quiet, errors only; 1 = Show status. Default; 2 = more info about errors; 3 =
          more info about everything; 4 = more info about everything + stderr;

          It can be combined with specific log items (stderr, full_failed_command, commands,
          actions, status, stats, success) to fine-tune the verbosity of the log. Example usage
          "-v=1,stderr"

          [default: 1]

      --oncall <ONCALL>
          The oncall executing this command

      --client-metadata <CLIENT_METADATA>
          Metadata key-value pairs to inject into Buck2's logging. Client metadata must be of the
          form `key=value`, where `key` is a snake_case identifier, and will be sent to backend
          datasets
