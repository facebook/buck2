# Parse and resolve Makefile's produce by ocamldeps.
load("@prelude//:paths.bzl", "paths")

# [Note: Dynamic dependency calculations]
# ---------------------------------------
# We are given the contents of a Makefile produced by ocamldep in -native mode e.g.
# ```
#      quux.cmi:
#      quux.cmx:
#        quux.cmi
#      corge.cmx:
#        quux.cmx
#```
# and the sources we care about.
#
#'parse_makefile' produces a mapping of which sources depend on which. In fact,
# it computes a pair of mappings:
#
# Result (1):  Replace '.cmi' with '.mli' and '.cmx' with '.ml' e.g.
# ```
#      quux.mli:
#      quux.ml:
#        quux.mli
#      corge.ml:
#        quux.ml
# ```
# If -opqaue is not in effect then this reflects the dependency requirements
# that enable cross module inlining (see the description of the -opaque flag [in
# the ocamlopt manual](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/native.html)).

# Result(2):
#
#   If '-opqaue' is not in effect, then this is a copy of result(1). If though
#   '-opaque' is in effect, replace 'foo.cmx' with 'foo.cmi' in the RHS of rules
#   as long as there is a rule with LHS 'foo.cmi' in the ocamldep input. Then,
#   replace '.cmi' with .mli' and '.cmx' with '.ml' as before e.g.
# ```
#      quux.mli:
#      quux.ml:
#        quux.mli
#      corge.ml:
#        quux.mli
# ```
# This mapping reflects the dependency requirements that don't admit cross
# module inlining (cutting down significantly on recompilations when only a
# module implementation and not its interface is changed).
