# Superconsole

## 0.2.0 (June 5, 2023)

The major change from the last release is that `State` has been deleted in favor of `render` taking a reference to the components. In addition there were a number of API adjustments, including:

* Add the type `Lines` wrapping `Vec<Line>`.
* Add `Span::new_colored` and `Span::new_colored_lossy`.
* Remove the `line!` macro and add more utilities to the `Line` type, making its internals private.
* Rename `x`/`y` to `width`/`height` where it makes sense.

## 0.1.0 (February 3, 2022)

* Initial version.
