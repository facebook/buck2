# Typically, rustc has access to a "sysroot," which is a directory tree with a known layout that
# contains a number of pre-compiled rlibs that are available by default. This includes, for example,
# the standard library. If explicit sysroot deps are passed on the toolchain, the sysroot is not
# made available to rustc. Instead, all crates which would normally be members of the sysroot must
# be passed explicitly here.
#
# Most sysroot deps typically behave as if they were transitive dependencies of the crate being
# compiled. That means they are not guaranteed to be included in the link, and the user must write
# `extern crate;` to access them. The crates singled out here behave differently in that regard,
# which is why they are singled out.
#
# Toolchains are free to omit any crates they like from this list; those crates will simply not be
# available in the compilation.
