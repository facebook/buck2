## .buckconfig

The root of your [project](#project) must contain a configuration file named
`.buckconfig`. Before executing, Buck2 reads this file to incorporate specified
customizations. See [.buckconfig](buckconfig.md) for more info.

## Action

An individual, cacheable, ideally hermetic command that's run during the
[build](#buck-file). It takes [artifacts](#artifact) as inputs and produces
other artifacts as outputs. An example command could be `gcc -o main main.c`,
which takes the artifact `main.c` (a source file) and produces the artifact
called `main` (the compiled binary).

## Action digest

Encoded [action](#action) representation. It is sent to
[remote execution](#remote-execution-re). Used among other things to retrieve
action inputs and to check for cache hits

## Action graph

The dependency graph of all [actions](#action) belonging to a target: it can be
queried with `buck2 aquery`.

## Artifact

A single input or output of an [action](#action). These are files that
participate as inputs or outputs of a build and can be source files or build
outputs. For more information, see the
[Artifact API](https://buck2.build/docs/api/build/Artifact/).

## Attribute

Declared by a [rule](#rule) and used to express the properties of a particular
instance of a rule to create a [target](#target). For example, srcs, deps and
copts, which declare a target's source files, dependencies, and custom compiler
options, respectively. The available attributes for a target depend on its rule
type.

## BUCK file

A `BUCK` file (the name is configurable, some projects use `TARGETS`) is the
main configuration file that tells Buck2 what to build, what their dependencies
are, and how to build them. Buck2 takes a `BUCK` file as input and evaluates the
file to declare [targets](#target), which are then used to create a graph of
dependencies and to derive the [actions](#action) that must be completed to
build intermediate and final software outputs. A `BUCK` file marks a directory
and any sub-directories not containing a `BUCK` file as a [package](#package).

## BXL

BXL ([Buck eXtension Language](../../bxl)) scripts are written in
[Starlark](#starlark) (a restricted subset of Python) and give integrators the
ability to inspect and interact directly with the buck2 graph.

BXL scripts can query the [action graph](#action-graph),
[configured graph](#configured-graph), and
[unconfigured graph](#unconfigured-graph). They can also create
[actions](#action) and trigger builds.

## Cell

Originally intented to allow for migration of repositories with different setups
into one monorepo.The cell root always contains a [.buckconfig](#buckconfig),
although the presence of a .buckconfig file doesn't in itself define a cell.
Cells are specified in the .buckconfig for the Buck [project](#project).

## Configuration

Configurations consist of a set of 'constraint values' that are used to resolve
`select` [attributes](#attribute) prior to evaluating [rule](#rule)
implementations: the attribute takes the value of the first branch in the
`select` that matches the configuration.

Configurations are instantiated by rules that produce a `PlatformInfo`
[provider](#provider). Once created, targets can receive their configuration
through a variety of mechanisms, such as:

- Inheritance - by default, when following a dependency edge A -> B, B inherits
  A's configuration.
- The `default_target_platform` attribute and `--target-platforms` command line
  flag.
- [Transitions](#transition) (see below).

Configurations allow a single target to exist in multiple variants in the
configured graph (for example, to build a given binary at differing optimization
levels or targeting different CPU architectures).

## Configured graph

The configured target graph is generated by configuring target nodes in the
[unconfigured target graph](#unconfigured-graph). That is, `selects` are fully
resolved and configurations applied. The configured graph includes information
about the [configurations](#configuration) and [transitions](#transition)
involved in building targets. The same target may appear in multiple different
configurations (when printed, the configuration is after the target in
parentheses).

## Constraint

A constraint represents a property that may differ across different
[target](#target) or build contexts, such as CPU architecture, the version of a
system-installed compiler, optimization level, which version of a particular
library to use, etc.

## Daemon

The Daemon process lives between invocations and is designed to allow for cache
reuse between Buck2 invocations, which can considerably speed up builds. For
more information, see [Daemon (buckd)](daemon.md).

## Dependency

A directed edge between two [targets](#target). A target `A` can have a
dependency on target `B`, for example, if any `dep` attribute of `A` mentions
`B`. A target's dependence on another target is determined by the
[visibility](#visibility) of the latter.

## Execution platform

A type of [rule](#rule) that includes information such as what execution types a
[target](#target) supports, which can be [remote](#remote-execution-re), local,
and [hybrid](#hybrid-execution) execution. Also, whether it supports cache
uploads, which allows users to get cache hits for things that executed locally.

## Hybrid execution

Allows Buck2 to race local and remote execution and get whichever finishes first
(unless there's a cache hit, then it will get output from cache). This can
provide substantial speedup by eliminating the overhead of going to
[remote execution](#remote-execution-re) when there is enough capacity to
service the build locally.

## Isolation dir

Instances of Buck2 share a [daemon](#daemon) if and only if their isolation
directory is identical. The isolation directory also influences the output paths
provided by Buck2. See [Isolation dir](isolation_dir.md) for more info.

## Modifiers

It's a modification of a constraint from the existing
[configuration](#configuration) to obtain a new configuration. They provide a
unified way to specify build settings on a [project](#project),
[target](#target), and command line level. It is intended to replace
[target platforms](#target-platform) and most use cases of
[.buckconfigs](#buckconfig).

## Package

A directory that contains a Buck2 [BUCK file](#buck-file) and all source files
belonging to the same directory as the BUCK file, or any of its subdirectories
that do not contain a BUCK file themselves.

## Prelude

The prelude is a unique `.bzl` file located at `prelude//prelude.bzl`. Buck2
implicitly loads all the symbols defined in the prelude whenever it loads a
[`BUCK`](#buck-file) file. Symbols defined outside the prelude can be imported
via a `load()` statement.

When you create a Buck2 project using `buck2 init --git`, it will contain the
same prelude used internally at Meta by Buck2 users. It is viewable at
https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/prelude.

## Project

The Outermost directory where there is a [.buckconfig](#buckconfig): also known
as the [root cell](#cell). The .buckconfig for the project specifies the
[cells](#cell) that constitute the Buck2 project. Specifically, these cells are
specified in the '[cells]' section of the `.buckconfig`. All command invocations
are executed from the project root.

## Provider

Data returned from a [rule](#rule) function. It's the only way that information
from this rule is available to other rules that depend on it (see
[dependency](#dependency)). For more information, see
[Providers](https://buck2.build/docs/rule_authors/writing_rules/#providers).

## Platform

A named set of [constraints](#constraint), defining a specific runtime
environment. E.g. `cpu=x86_64, os=windows`

## Remote execution (RE)

Distributed execution of [actions](#action) on remote workers. It can speed up
builds significantly by scaling the nodes available for parallel actions, and by
caching action outputs across Buck2 users.

## Rule

A rule consists of an attribute spec and an implementation, which is a
[Starlark](#starlark) function.

The attribute spec declares what attributes the rule expects to receive. The
rule implementation receives the [attributes](#attribute) of a [target](#target)
and the [providers](#provider) of its [dependencies](#dependency). It can
declare new [actions](#action) and [artifacts](#artifact) and must return
[providers](#provider) that can be used to pass data to its dependents or to
Buck2 itself.

Rules are instantiated in [BUCK files](#buck-file) to declare targets and set
their attributes. The rule implementation is called when Buck2 needs its
providers, which can happen when the target is built, or when one of its
dependents is.

As an example, the `cxx_binary` rule could be used to create a C++ binary, but
`android_binary` rule would be used to create an Android APK

## Starlark

Starlark is a dialect of Python originally developed by Google for the
[Bazel build tool](https://bazel.build/rules/language). It is the configuration
language of the Buck2 build system and the language you use in `.bzl` and
[`BUCK` files](#buck-file) to define and instantiate [rules](#rule).

There are many reasons why Meta has chosen Starlark, as detailed in
[The Rust Starlark library](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/04/08/rust-starlark-library/)
article.

The Buck2 project maintains and uses an open source
[Starlark interpreter in Rust](https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust).

## Subtarget

Collection of [providers](#provider) that can be accesed by name. The subtargets
can have their own subtargets as well, which can be accessed by chaining them,
e.g.: `buck2 build cell//foo:bar[baz][qux]`.

## Target

An object that is defined in a [BUCK file](#buck-file). Targets represent the
buildable units of a build from the perspective of the end user. Declared by
instantiating a [rule](#rule) with attributes. A target has
[dependencies](#dependency), which are references to other targets.

## Target label

The identifier for a [target](#target). Structured as
`cell_alias//path/to/package:target`, where `cell_alias//` maps to a
[cell root](#cell) path (as defined in the [./buckconfig](#buckconfig) of the
cell this target belongs to), `path/to/package` is the [package](#package)
directory that contains the [BUCK file](#buck-file) declaring the target
(relative to the mapped cell alias), and `:target` is the target's name.

## Target pattern

A string that resolves to a set of [targets](#target). They can be used as
arguments to commands such as `buck2 build` and `buck2 uquery`. They can also be
used in the [visibility](#visibility) argument of a [rule](#rule). For more
information, see [Target pattern](./target_pattern.md).

## Target platform

Represents the [platform](#platform) that the final output is built for residing
and executing. If buck2 is a chef, and the output is the meal, the target
platform would be the people that eat the meal.

## Target universe

A set of configured targets and their transitive deps. In the context of cquery
and build in the Buck2 CLI, any literals are resolved to all matching targets
within the universe. Target universe can be passed explicitly on the Buck2 CLI
via `--target-universe`. If omitted, the target universe will be inferred by
constructing a universe using all the target literals (and their transitive
deps) within the query string for cquery.

## Transition

Allows the [configuration](#configuration) to change across a
[dependency](#dependency) edge. That is, normally, if [target](#target) A
depends on target B, then if the configuration for A is X, then B is configured
using X too. By using a transition, you can produce X to configure B instead.

## Unconfigured graph

A graph of [targets](#target) before [configurations](#configuration) are
applied. Can be queried via `buck2 uquery`.

## Visibility

Determines whether a [target](#target) can include another [target](#target) as
its [dependency](#dependency). For more information, see
[Visibility](./visibility.md).
