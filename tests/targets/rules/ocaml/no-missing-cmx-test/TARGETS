# Binary 'test' has a transitive dependency (through library 'foo') on
# library 'bar'. If this set of targets is give to buck1, compilation
# of main.ml will fail with the error:
#
#   Error (warning 58 [no-cmx-file]): no cmx file was found in path
#   for module Bar, and its interface was not compiled with -opaque
#
# This is because the compile command for main.ml does not include -I
# path/to/dir/where/bar.cmx.
#
# buck2 avoids this by ensuring there is a -I that reaches each .cmx
# in every dependent library, including those that are only indirectly
# depended upon.
