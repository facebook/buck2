# let's just sleep for a while to make sure we don't introduce flakyness. Also
# note that this should be unnecessary since there is only one top-level target
# here, but this breaks because critical path calculations are not aware of
# dependencies induced by the *inputs* of `dynamic_action`: they're only aware
# of the inputs used by the actions declared in `dynamic_action`.
