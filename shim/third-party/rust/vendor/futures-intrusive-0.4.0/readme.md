futures-intrusive
=================

This crate provides a variety of `Futures`-based and `async/await` compatible
types that are based on the idea of intrusive collections:
- Channels in a variety of flavors:
  - Oneshot
  - Multi-Producer Multi-Consumer (MPMC)
  - State Broadcast
- Synchronization Primitives:
  - Manual Reset Event
  - Mutex
  - Semaphore
- A timer

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/futures-intrusive) for details.

In addition to the documentation the examples provide a quick overview on how
the primitives can be used.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures-intrusive = "^0.4"
```

In order to use the crate in a `no-std` environment, it needs to be compiled
without default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures-intrusive = { version = "^0.4", default-features = false }
```

The crate defines a feature `alloc`, which can be used in order to re-enable
`alloc` features. Also defined is `std`, which can be used in order to re-enable
`std` features.

## Minimum Rust version

The minimum required Rust version is 1.36, due to reliance on stable
`Future`, `Context` and `Waker` types.
