//! A 'Configuration' is a set of attributes that are attached to each node in
//! the 'static graph' that affects the behaviour of the build. Examples of
//! these attributes are the target platform, and compiler settings.
//!
//! 'Configuration's are propagated from the top level request node to each of
//! the transitive child nodes. During propagation, the configuration may change
//! under a "transition". Multiple distinct configurations may be applied to the
//! transitive graph, effectively duplicating the graph to create two distinct
//! graphs with different build behaviours (split-transitions).
