Welcome to Buck2, a large scale, fast, reliable, and extensible build tool
developed and used by Meta. Buck2 supports a variety of languages on many
platforms.

Buck2's core is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
[Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), which is a deterministic,
immutable dialect of Python, is used to extend the Buck2 build system, enabling
Buck2 to be language-agnostic. With Starlark, users can define their own custom
rules.

Buck2 leverages the Bazel spec of
[Remote Build Execution](https://bazel.build/remote/rbe) as the primary means of
parallelization and caching, which increases the importance of idempotency (no
matter how many times an operation is performed, it yields the same result) and
hermeticity (code is sealed off from the world), giving the right results,
reliably.

Buck2 multi-language support includes C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust,
Erlang, OCaml, and more.

The following sub-sections contain a list of links to key points in the Buck2
Documentation website that explain the advantages of using Buck2 for you and
your team.
