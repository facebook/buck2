//! The BlobStore: where the blobs behind the daemon's tracked file digests are, and how to get
//! them back. It is the digest interner with its backings made explicit, a recorded CAS
//! expiration and a recorded stash entry, the stash directory under buck-out that keeps content
//! this daemon produced and the CAS is not known to hold, and one walk over the table that
//! refreshes CAS expirations. Where a digest's entry says the stash holds the blob, the
//! materializer links the content out of it before asking the CAS.
//!
//! The stash holds exactly the blobs some `TrackedFileDigest` is held for and the CAS is not
//! known to hold, and starts empty with every daemon. An insertion writes a file under a name of
//! its own and commits by recording it on the digest's entry in one atomic step; a second
//! insertion of the same digest finds the record and removes its own file. The record leaves the
//! entry when the entry leaves the table, at the last handle's drop or at a walk, or when a CAS
//! expiration is recorded for the blob, and the interner hands it to this store's collector,
//! which unlinks the file. Nothing coordinates in memory beyond that, and nothing reads the
//! directory: what the table does not record is not in the stash.
