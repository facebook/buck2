"""
With `buck2.write_action_cache` on, a write action asks the action cache for its content under a
key that is a hash of its command line. A hit declares the output as a CAS download without
rendering the content, and nothing is written until something needs the file. A miss renders the
content and produces it the way a run action's output comes to be: written to its path when the
machine has room for local work, uploaded to the CAS and declared from there when it does not. A
write whose key falls within `buck2.write_action_cache_populate`, under an executor that publishes
local results (`allow_cache_uploads`), goes through the cache whatever the mode says, and a miss
first uploads the content and records the entry for later builds. Under `verify` every write is
rendered and declared as without the cache, and a hit is only compared against it.

The daemon is killed between recording and looking up, so that a hit says the key is the same
from one process to the next.
