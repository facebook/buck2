    The shell command to run to generate the output file. It is the
     fallback for `bash` and `cmd_exe` arguments. The following environment variables are populated by
     Buck and available to the shell command. They are accessed using
     the syntax:


    ```
    ${<variable>}
    ```


     Example:


    ```
    ${SRCS}
    ```

    `${SRCS}`


     A string expansion of the `srcs` argument delimited
     by the `environment_expansion_separator` argument
     where each element of `srcs` will be translated
     into a relative path.


    `${SRCDIR}`


     The relative path to a directory to which sources are copied
     prior to running the command.


    `${OUT}`


     The output file or directory for the `genrule()`.
     This variable will have whatever value is specified by
     the `out` argument if not using named outputs. If
     using named outputs, this variable will be the output directory.


     The value should be a valid filepath. The semantics of the shell
     command determine whether this filepath is treated as a file or a
     directory. If the filepath is a directory, then the shell command
     needs to create it if not using named outputs. Otherwise, it will
     be automatically created. All outputs (directories and files) must
     be readable, writable, and (in the case of directories) executable
     by the current user.


     The file or directory specified by this variable must always
     be written by this command. If not, the execution of this
     rule will be considered a failure, halting the build process.


    `${TMP}`


     A temporary directory which can be used for intermediate
     results and will not be bundled into the output.
