//! Freezing a complex value whose frozen representation is chosen at runtime.
//!
//! Freezing a value copies it to the frozen heap and leaves a forwarding record in its
//! place, so that every other value pointing at it finds the copy. The forward has to
//! be in place *before* the value's fields are frozen, because a field may point back
//! at the value. Writing the forward takes the copy's address, so its space has to be
//! reserved first, and that takes its size. When the frozen type is fixed, the size is
//! known from the type ([`Freeze`](crate::values::Freeze)); when it is chosen at runtime,
//! the value has to be looked at first. That is the whole reason for the shape of
//! [`FreezeDynamic`]: freezing is a look and then a consume, with the reservation and the
//! forward between them.
//!
//! ```text
//!        unfrozen heap                                  frozen heap
//!  src: [ vtable | payload: T ]
//!
//!  1  plan = payload.prepare_freeze(freezer)   look, don't consume: reuse an existing
//!                                              value, or allocate for some type and size
//!  2  plan.target().reserve(freezer)           [ RESERVED(size) | ........ ]  a FreezeSlot
//!                                              (an existing value: forward src to it, done)
//!  3  payload = overwrite_with_forward(src)    [ FORWARD -> slot ]  read out first: the
//!                                              forward is two words and clobbers its start
//!  4  plan.freeze_into(payload, freezer, slot) freezes the fields (`Freezer::freeze`
//!                                              follows forwards, possibly into this very
//!                                              slot), builds the frozen value, and
//!                                              `slot.write(it)`, which publishes:
//!                                              [ vtable | frozen value ]  a live Value<'fv>
//! ```
//!
//! The driver is [`freeze_dynamic`]. What is checked, and where:
//!
//! * [`FreezeSlot::write`] checks that what it is given is exactly what was reserved:
//!   the same allocation size, because heap walks stride by the published header's
//!   size, and the same drop region, because a destructor outside it never runs. A
//!   plan that selects one target and writes another gets a [`FreezeError`], not
//!   undefined behaviour. (Alignment needs no check: every value type is bounded by
//!   the arena's alignment at compile time.)
//! * The driver checks that the value a plan returns is the slot it was given, and
//!   that the slot is published. A plan can come by the slot's address before writing
//!   it, because a field that pointed back at the source freezes to the forward, so the
//!   returned value alone is not evidence of a write.
//! * Until `write` publishes the value, the reservation word stays in place. If a plan
//!   fails or unwinds, the frozen heap stays walkable and droppable. The sources already
//!   forwarded point at a reservation, however, so the whole freeze is abandoned;
//!   debug builds enforce this.
//!
//! The blanket [`FreezeDynamic`] implementation for [`Freeze`](crate::values::Freeze)
//! follows the same protocol: its plan selects `Freeze::Frozen` at the frozen heap's brand
//! as a simple target, and `Freeze::freeze` builds the value that `write` publishes.
