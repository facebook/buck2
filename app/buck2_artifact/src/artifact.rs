//! An 'Artifact' represents a File to be used as part of the build. It can be either a file in the
//! source tree, or a file to be generated as part of the build.
//!
//! The existence of an Artifact does not mean the actual file exists. Artifacts needs to be
//! 'made available' before its existence on the filesystem is guaranteed.
//!
//! An 'Artifact' is first "declared" by rule implementation as a 'DeclaredArtifact'. The artifact
//! will need to be "bound" to an 'Action' through being used as an 'OutputArtifact'. Once bound,
//! it becomes a 'BuildArtifact' that can be available.
